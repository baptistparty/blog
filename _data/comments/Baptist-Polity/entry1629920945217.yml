message: "Caleb -- thanks for commenting!  I thought I might get a plurality of elders objection, but this is even more thoughtful! \r\n\r\nAt this level (where all the offices/roles are scriptural), I suppose  each box derives authority from God.  The \"elders\" are a divinely authorized office, but also put in relation to a specific congregation with specific members.    The deacons are directly authorized by God, but in relation to the other God-authorized groups.   \r\n\r\nTo use a family analogy, God establishes a relationship between husband and wife, but I wouldn't say that relationship is best described by thinking of the wife \"deriving\" her authority from husband.    \r\n\r\nSo I think the \"boxes\" would capture what Mark said to you.  Or maybe I could draw a box around the entire church to show that each office has divine authority."
