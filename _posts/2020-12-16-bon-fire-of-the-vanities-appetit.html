<p>If you praise Afghan saffron, you "deligitimize" Iranian saffron by failing to condemn the US sanctions. </p>
<p><em>BA</em> is fundamentally an escapist project.  It sells a life you do not have, using ingredients and equipment you cannot acquire. At least, you cannot acquire all of it.  <em>BA</em> produces videos of Harvard graduates literally reinventing the wheel, reproducing mass market foods from scratch, in a sky-kitchen spreading over Manhattan.  Its hosts are artisians -- the ingenuius individusals, devoted to a craft, in a famous locale, with witty friends. </p>
<p>But BA can't soar above mass-market food without commodified publishing and commodified audiences.  If it were not for millions of people paying attention -- literally paying with their attention --  and buying ridiculously priced goods from advertisers, only the fantastically wealthy could afford to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TudhYwBrgYg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="external-link no-image">gourmet skittles </a> (twelve million views) or<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1GFJxVeH9c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="external-link no-image"> one-off instant ramen</a>(eleven million views) in a Manhattan sky-kitchen. And if no one else could watch them being made, it's not clear why the fantastically wealthy would even care. </p>
<p>What new fantasy is BA peddling, then?  What dream requires engaging in the <em>realpolitik</em> of saffron?  Why must your own nation's sanctions policy (approved by a democratic legislature, to deter widely-hated nuclear war!) be tangentially denounced in an article about the cullinary uses of rare seasoning? </p>
<p>If <em>Conde Naste</em> used to sell <em>BA</em> to <em>temporarily embarrassed millionaires,</em> it now seems to sell to the <em>holier than thou.</em> </p>
