title: MereOrthodoxy & White Evangelical Crap
---

<p>Jake Meador spends some time looking for America Christianity <a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/defining-white-evangelical-crap/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="external-link no-image">after "the White Evangelical Crap</a>." </p>
<p>One source of the crap: too much separation of church and state. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you deny to government the chance to explicitly acknowledge the kingship of Christ in the very particular and specific way that government ought to, then it becomes very difficult to define the exact relationship between God and government. So government will constantly be veering toward an over-definition of its submission to Jesus or an under-definition of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another: personal property, and individual self-designation. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, they simply created their own identities, independent of geography and independent of any concern with neighbor. And it is this act of self-designation that Jennings sees as being the heart of â€œwhiteness.â€...
The economic views exist because an extremely thick doctrine of private property is central to that autonomyâ€”self-designating is expensive, basically. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been critical of the long conservative tradition of sniffing out Marxism everywhere in intra-evangelical justice debates.  But now the theory is that personal autonomy should be reduced by altering the doctrine of private property, for the benefit of society? </p>
<p>Isn't that ... socialism? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>soÂ·cialÂ·ism
/ËˆsÅSHÉ™ËŒlizÉ™m/
noun
a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.</p>
