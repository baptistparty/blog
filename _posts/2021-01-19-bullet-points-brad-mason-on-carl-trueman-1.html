A quick rundown of part one shows it probably won't go anywhere useful.</p>
<p>Brad's Word Count: 2,669</p>
<p>Brad's claim: Trueman makes three false claims: (a) that CRT has &ldquo;basic claims,&rdquo; (b) among them are &ldquo;racism is systemic&rdquo; and (c) &ldquo;being non-racist is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Brad's Argument 1: CRT is undefinable, therefore Trueman is wrong about claims a, b, and c.  </p>
<ul><li>Response: 
<ul><li>It's impossible to argue an undefinable concept.  We certainly can't prove Trueman is wrong, if there's no definition.  But Brad recognizes this is just preening, and admits in the next section that there really is <em>some</em> consensus about <em>some</em> claims.  </li>
<li>Scholarly language refutation:   Just like "critical legal studies," it is widely accepted both within and outside critical movements that "scholars share sufficient themes, arguments, and approaches "to permit intelligent discussion of the movement as a whole." Johnson, Do You Sincerely Want to Be Radical?, 36 STAN. L. REV. 247, 249 (1984). (Yes, Johnson is writing before CRT proper, but this is fair for all the "critical" theories). </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Brad's Argument 2: Trueman "shows little awareness" of either Critical Race Theory itself or the broader tradition, because scholars of CRT don't use the words Trueman uses in b or c. </p>
<ul><li>Brad's Evidence for the Argument: Brad shows 11 bullet points and a paragraph, and none of them contain the exact words used by Trueman.    </li>
<li>Response: 
<ul><li>Most of this "argument" is spent claiming Brad's target lacks sufficient knowledge, reading, credentials, or training.  This is Brad's most frequent 'argument,' but it is not really an argument.</li>
<li>Brad's eleven bullet points and a paragraph from Crenshaw do not show that Carl has "little awareness" or unfairly characterized or summarized CRT.  Failing to use the same words or phrasing does not tell us whether Trueman understands or misundertsands CRT. The question is whether the words Trueman does use fairly describe the theory.</li>
<li>In showing how "aware" scholars would describe CRT, Brad proves he was wrong about Argument 1.  CRT has some intelligible claims that educated people fairly describe as claims of Critical Race Theory. <strong>Trueman is right about claim a.</strong> </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Brad's Argument 3: <a href="/blog/brad-mason-on-carl-trueman/a" title="Brad says: As for 'racism is systemic,' a way of understanding this claim is certainly included within CRT">CRT does make claims about systemic racism</a>, but Trueman is <a href="/blog/brad-mason-on-carl-trueman/a" title="Brad says: 'But the general idea of systemic racism is an inheritance of the traditional civil rights discourse, not a creation of CRT'">wrong that such claims are exclusive to CRT</a>.</p>
<ul><li>Response: 
<ul><li>Brad admits that CRT makes claims about systemic racism.  "A way of understanding [systemic racism] is certainly included within CRT." <strong>Trueman is right about claim b</strong></li>
<li>Trueman does not say systemic racism is exclusive to CRT, and Trueman never says his argument depends on describing things "exclusive" to CRT.  Argument 3 was a straw man.  </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Brad's Argument 4: CRT does not make a claim about "being non-racist is impossible," so Trueman is wrong about claim c. </p>
<ul><li>Brad's guess: "My guess is that Trueman gets this idea from a marginal awareness of Ibram X Kendi&rsquo;s work ... these definitions are peculiar to Kendi and not particularly reflective of CRT scholarship."</li>
<li>Response: 
<ul><li>Notice that Brad again engages in <em>ad hominem</em> attacks, assuming that...</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol>
