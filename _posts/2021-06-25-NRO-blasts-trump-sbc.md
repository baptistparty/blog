Kevin Williamson blasts everyone to the right of Ed Litton:

>Ed Litton, a moderate reformer, has been elected president of the Southern Baptist Convention — and the Reverend R. Albert Mohler has been served his mess of pottage, cold and unsalted. 

> The Reverend Mohler, the publicity-hog president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville ... made the usual binary-choice argument in the usual schoolboy fashion, treating the pro-abortion agenda and sexual radicalism of the Democratic Party as a moral get-out-of-jail-free card for the GOP, for Donald Trump, and, consequently, for himself. ... But his political works were not sufficient to save him: In the four-way race for SBC president, he didn’t even make the runoff. He simply was not quick enough on his theological feet to get out in front of the Baptist parade.

> A moribund organization engages in a bitter fight over control of its scanty remaining resources, to the great detriment of the organization and its mission and to the material benefit of a few would-be media personalities and frustrated office-seekers.  Sound familiar?

A couple of comments notes: 
1. The SBC CRT controversy managed to predate the Republican version by a good three or four years, beginning with the recommendations from SBTS and SEBTS faculty.  
2.  While this article was criticized by notable SBCers, it was treated as "harsh but fair" by several others.
