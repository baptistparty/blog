Fascinating throughout, but it starts here with Niall Ferguson: 
   > “I was brought up an atheist—I didn’t become one,” he said. “I regard atheism as the religious faith I happened to be brought up in. It is, of course, as much a faith as Christianity or Islam—and **I have the Calvinist brand, because my parents left the Church of Scotland. I was brought up, essentially, in a Calvinist ethical framework but with no God.** This had its benefits—I was encouraged to think in a very critical way about religion and also about science, but I’ve come to see as a historian that you can’t base a society on that. **Indeed, atheism, particularly in its militant forms, is really a very dangerous metaphysical framework for a society.”**
