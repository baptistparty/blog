I think Bart's 'ettiquette' suggestions are pretty good, especially:
> your default vote should be a "Nay" until the resolution earns your "Aye."

But, I'm not sure even our most Reformed have that stoicism in us. 

Witness the debate on the resolution [on abuse and pastoral qualificatioins](https://www.sbc.net/resource-library/resolutions/on-abuse-and-pastoral-qualifications/), messengers were told (from the floor) that it was embarassing to debate too long before a watching world, and (from the platform) that it was better to have a strong, non-binding statement, rather than condition it to death like legislation.  Local churches could always qualify it for themselves, but it would be good to have a feel-good 'aye' now, and your logical 'nays' later. 

But the passage of the abortion abolition resolution on similar grounds has now caused a [kerfuffle among SBC ethicists](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2021/06/76465/). The chairman of the ResCom is [proclaiming vindication for trying to stop the messengers from making a mistake](https://twitter.com/drjamesmerritt/status/1407685109973651459).  It seems like the same could be said said of it, though: give us a stronger, clearer 'aye' for the watching world, because it's non-binding. Let's not qualify our prophetic statements to death. 

If we're going to frame Resolutions as statements about timely moral issues, I'm not sure we have it in us to risk a 'no.'
