    The April-June issue of the 9Marks journal is out, and the topic is "Deacons."  
    
    I'm grateful for 9Marks' resuscitation of the elder.  The return of a "plurality of elders" among 21st Century Baptists can be chalked up almost entirely to 9Marks, along with a few friends like Founders. 
   
    But that leads to a question seldom asked: where did all the elders **go**? Why was the "a pastor and the deacons" combination nearly universal in Southern Baptist churches for over a century? 
    
    In the Nine Marks of a Healthy Church, Mark Dever suggests [“inattention to Scripture” and “the pressure of life on the frontier” may have contributed to the decline of elder plurality.](https://www.9marks.org/review/elders-congregational-life-phil-newton/).  
    
    Those are both right, in a sense, but I think we're missing the most important part. 

    
    # Limits to the standard explanation
    
    Were American Baptists 'inattentive to scripture'?  In some sense, all sin is a failure to heed God's commands in scripture.  But if there's a "Baptist" trait, it's persnickitiness about the scripture on churches.  Having rejected Popes, bishops, synods, presbyters, sessions, and state churches, Baptists insist they want church **as the Bible commands,** no more, and no less.  The 19th and 20th centuries had no shortage of literalists and Fundamentalists willing to call out deviations. There were hardshells and landmarkers, anti-missionary baptists, anti-missionary society baptists, anti-Sunday school baptists. The Baptist committement to following scripture and individual conscience is so high, they appear schismatic to many outsiders.    
    
    So while any error is connected to inattention to scripture, it's still strange that there was never much of a fight between  "elderists" and  "deaconists."  No group called out the encroaching pragmatism and liberalism of the deaconists, and no deaconists claimed the primacy of orthopraxy before a watching world. If a plurality of elders is biblical and historic, how did the deaconists win without a fight? 

    Was it furthered by "life on the frontier?"  Again, yes, in some sense. The shortage of ministers during the westward expansion meant many churches were irregular.  In my home state, Missouri, missionary pastors arrived shortly after the Louisana Purchase, and would ride circuit. Many Baptist churches held services only once or twice a month. The idea of a "cooperative" mission budget developed in Missouri when a glut of guest-preaching fundraisers threatened to take over most of the preaching in frontier churches.

    But even on the frontier (and reconstruction) Baptists longed for regularity. They understood the goal was to have their own deacons and preacher, and to meet each Sabbath if not more often.  

    So how did people attentive to scripture, and longing for New Testament polity, wind up with a "deacon-led" polity? Like the answer to so many Baptist questions, you'll need to go back to the Glorious Revolution to find the answer.

# Baptists Respond to Persecution, New Freedom in the 17th Century

    As you'll recall, after Henry the VIII broke with Rome, the Church of England viciously persecuted anyone that did not submit themselves to that Church.  Baptists believed the Bible took away the King's authority over religious matters, and refused to submit. And so they were persecuted, along with other groups of "nonconformists."        

    In the late 17th Century, Baptists found a friend in King James II, who had converted to Catholicism later in life. James' conversion was scandalous but tolerated, as his heir was a protestant daughter.  He was able to use his personal power to blunt persecution of nonconformists, and his "Declaration for Liberty of Conscience" was welcomed by many Baptists.  But many Anglicans feared James was paving the way for a return to Catholicism. When James fathered a Catholic son in 1688, it threatened to create a Catholic dynasty, and the nation was plunged in crisis. A few weeks later, seven Protestant nobles begged Prince William of Orange to invade.  William, a Dutch Calvinist, had married James' daughter, Mary.  When William landed in England with a small army, James fled. 

    This "Glorious Revolution" meant the English monarch would remain protestant. But William and Mary also saw no reason to force dissenting protestants into league with dissenting Catholics.  As they viewed Catholicism (and Catholic countries) as the real political danger, one of the first acts of the new monarchs was an "Act of Toleration." The Act allowed nonconforming protestants to have schoolteachers and houses of worship, on certain conditions. [1]

    Now you'll understand why there was an explosion of Baptist works in the late 17th Century. Baptists were finally allowed to gather legally and write out their theology at length.  Much of the Second London Baptist Confession (dated 1689) responds to the political and legal questions around the new freedoms.[2]  So in the few years around the Glorious Revolution, Baptists laid down many of the patterns that we still follow today. 

#  What did the Act of Toleration do? 

    So here it is important to understand what the Act of Toleration actually allowed.  While it was a great leap forward for religious liberty, it was nothing like the United States' First Amendment. The Act of Toleration imposed a long oath of support to the King and Queen, and required swearing off Catholic doctrines. It did not allow nonconformists to hold most public offices.  

    And in order to preach, nonconformist ministers still had to affirm most of the Church of England's thirty-nine articles.  Nonconformist preachers had to register their place of preaching.  "Anabaptists" (and Baptists) could opt out of Article 27's paedobaptism.  Unlike their later, American counterparts, many early English Baptists seem to have agreed to take these oaths.[3]  
    
    And in order to meet, there was a separate requirement for the place of worship.  Each "congregation or assembly" was required to register a "place of meeting," with notice to the Bishop, local deacons, or the justices of the peace.

# Limits of the Act of Toleration, and Dissenters' Workarounds

    But the Toleration Act did **not** provide a neat way to put ministers, house of worship, and congregation under the same umbrella. Dissenters were banned from public office, and corporations were considered a public office from the King.  So law did not recognize a "Baptist Church."  The law recognized individual people.  Some individuals were permitted to preach.  And other individuals could gather to hear a permitted preacher, but only at  registered location.

    So some of the earliest Baptist meeting houses were actually houses.  An individual could register his home as a meeting place, and then arrange to have a minister preach.  Obviously,property owners tended to be wealthier and older patrons.  

    But what happened if the owner of the churchhouse died?  Or left for another denomination? How could the property be secured to a particular church, if dissenters could not form corporations?

    The common legal workaround was the "trust." Ancient English law allowed land owners to devote property to a charitable public purpose, including religion.  The land might be "owned" by one or more individuals, but the English courts would force the owners to honor the purpose of the "trust."  You could leave property to a single trustee, but as the entire purpose was to avoid the hassle of a person's death, trusts typically have more than one trustee.  And to avoid ties, there are usually *three* trustees.

# Effects of a legal system that didn't recognize churches

     It should come as no surprise, then, that trustees were often the deacons. Deacons are charged with care of the physical ministries of the church, and it is only natural that care of the physical property be entrusted to deacon-trustees. Even in those cases where the Deacons were not technically trustees, they oversaw the *use of the property.*    
    
     But you'll also see that, as the landowners, it was the trustees that legally allowed the congregation to gather on their land. And it was the land-owning trustees that allowed for any preacher. Because the minister had to register his preaching location, it was impossible to register without the consent of the Trustees. And even if the congregation elected a new pastor, it was the trustee-deacons who would have to consent.[3] 

     In fact, it was often the Trustees that arranged for a preacher for their congregations.  At some points, real estate speculators were building chapels to rent to dissenters.


# How the Trust deforms New Testament Polity. 

    So how did this deform New Testament polity?  At its root, dissenting churches were separated from their property, and elders had to mediate some of their connection to a congregation through the property -- and its keepers.  This meant the law gave the Trust and the Trustees a direct legal relationship to doctrine.  This little assumption was reinforced by law and circumstances for generations, until the workaround became the tradition. 

It might seem like churches would press to end these requirements. But the workaround was healthy enough to let churches be healthy enough.  In most congregations, elders, deacons, trustees and congregations aren't in conflict. If a church wanted a plurality of elders, it could have them.  

So this legal workaround, a holdover of persecution of the dissenters, became the blueprint for roughly 300 years.  Even in the United States, it was an open question whether State governments **should** recognize a 'church' as a corporation with its own property.  Only in the early 20th century did "general" corporation statutes become widespread, where legal entities could form on general rules, without a special charter from the legislature.
  
But a church could only become only-so-healthy.  The Church's vision of itself became influenced by the law and culture. When disagareement or conflict did arrive, the law gave a little more weight to the property-keepers.[6] 

# Conclusion

For a number of reasons, I think the English legal structure was the core reason for the growth of deacons.  When it was later combined with the "independent contractor" model of ministering after the Great Awakening, pragmatism built on pragmatism. 

That's not to say churches were wrong for trying to follow the gospel under the culture and law available to them.  But at some point, the pragmatism became the tradition, and developed its own intertia. 


[0] A [2010 review of Ben Merkle's 40 Questions about Elders and Deacons](https://www.9marks.org/review/40-questions-about-elders-and-deacons/) is described thus: "All elders are given the responsibility of ruling and teaching in the church ... and the deacons are to aid them in these pursuits by handling the details of the church." 

[1]  Why did William & Mary offer toleration?  The question of nonformists had split English political interests for a generation. James remained on the run, and a threat for several more months.  In order to solidify protestant power and alliances, William and Mary needed to retain moderate and radical nonconformists.  For more, see Scott Sowerby's remarkable reexamination of James II's legacy, [**Making Toleration: the Repealers and the Glorious Revolution**](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674073098).  

[2] Compare the Act's prohibition on disturbing Anglican services (at paragraph XV) (https://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol6/pp74-76), with the 2LBC's Chapter 26, Paragraph 13, prohibiting the interruption of any church-order (which is similar to the Savoy Declaration on this point.)

[3]   See, e.g., 1696 Oath Rolls for Baptist Ministers in London. http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C4956164.  While taken from earlier confessions, by the time of Toleration, Chapter 23 of the 2LBC allowing for oaths imposed by authority, in matters "ending all strife."  So why did Americans chafe at essentially the same rules?  According to one author, the system was unworkable in Virginia, especially for the itenerant evangelists the sprang up in the Great Awakening.  The Court that granted licesnes was in Williiamsburg, met twice a year, and required a new license (and fee) for each location. https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/act-of-toleration-1689/.  Some early Virginia Baptists did comply; the conflict seemss 

[3] Joseph Ivimey writes of an unfortunate incident at Prescot-street Baptist Chapel in 1752. James Fall, the son of a Baptist pastor in Watford, was invited by the deacons be pastor for six months.  At the end, a majority of the congregation voted to extend a call to Fall, but the deacon-trustees were opposed.  The deacons told the majority that could take and keep Fall, but not at the chapel.  And so began a new church at Little Alie Street.    Ivimey, Joseph. A History of the English Baptists: Comprising the principal events of the history of Protestant dissenterts, from the revolution 1668 till 1760; and of the London Baptist Churches, during that period. United Kingdom: Ivimey, 1823. pp. 555-561. 

[2]  It is interesting that the English Baptists didn't seem to take exception the Act of Toleration, while later American Baptists certainly did.   A dissenting minister could not teach until they had signed the required loyalty oaths, and signed a "Declaration of Approbation and Subscription" of most of the Anglican Church's Thirty-Nine Articles.  This involved going to chancery court, and formally signing a declaration, as well as paying a fee of not more than six pence.  It seems this resulted in some scrip that could be later checked by authorities. 

There was some debate about whether the Act applied in the colonies, but Presbyterian Samuel Davies obtained an opinion from the English Attorney General concluding that the Act did apply.  So the underlying legal system for dissenters was similar in both places. 

It seems the Americans especially chaffed against the practical implications, and the Anglican establishment was particularly vexing.  In Virginia, the Anglicans interpreted the only place of licensure to be in Williamsburg, twice a year. [Preaching before the long trip to Williamsburg was reason for denying future licenses](https://books.google.com/books?id=pO27K6rR0qoC&lpg=PA18&ots=hS5YOtnLKP&dq=act%20of%20toleration%20licensing%20ministers&pg=PA18#v=onepage&q=act%20of%20toleration%20licensing%20ministers&f=false). Ragosta at 18. The Virignia Courts apparently imposed a higher burden of proof, requiring examination by local Anglican clergy. And the Virginia establishment decided a minister could only be licensed to one meetinghouse.  This may not have been a problem in dense London, but it caused conflict with itinerant Presbyterians and Baptists on the Virginia frontier.   In the years leading up to the Revolution, and then through the Articles of Confederation, Seperatist Baptists were presecuted for refusing to license their meetings or their preaching.

[5] Attorney General v. Bunce, 37 LJ Ch. 697
<<<<<<< HEAD

[6]There are numerous cases involving seemingly incredible doctrinal transitions in dissenting chapels -- from Presbyterians hiring Baptist ministers, or slowly accepting Unitarians. How did this happen?  Well, English Courts generally decided that the *actions of the Trustees* were good evidence about the intention of the Trust, regardless of the actual faith of the congregation.
