Your Southern Baptist Convention entities have a Matthew 18 crisis.

No, not a Matthew 18:15 crisis, about how to deal with sin in the church.  A Matthew 18:18 crisis, about handling delegated authority.  

In Matthew 18:18, Jesus leaves the Church with some authority. In between the already and the not yet, He says: 
> Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.

That's some truly awesome **ad interim**[^1] authority; it's the church's 'in between' authority. And it sounds enormous. Elsewhere, Jesus said something similar to Peter, giving him the "Keys to the Kingdom of Heaven."   **Whatever you bind on earth? Whatever you loose on earth?**  That's sounds like the claimed authority of cardinals, mitres, and pontiffs.

But what did it really mean when Jesus says the church can act for Him?  He 'loosed' Lazarus from the dead (John 11:44); can I revive my dead relatives?  Or get my prodigal children into Heaven?   Jesus has the power over flesh; can we even pray the common cold out of our churches?  At the Name of Jesus, every knee will bow; should the masses bow at our name?   No.

Okay, so maybe those aren't the kind of powers God gives away.  What about powers God does give away in the Old Testament; do we get that?  Can we grow long hair and get super strength?  Can we split the Red Sea? Can we stop the sun? Can we hit a rock and get water? No.

So was Jesus *lying* when he said we have authority to act for him? No.

"Whatever" might look like a big, general delegaation of power, but it isn't. The general words ("keys," "whatever") are interpreted in context and with reference to other scriptures.  In your introduction to hermaneutics class, hopefully you learn the principle of non-contradiction -- the Bible should be interpreted not to contradict itself.  

Giving the church "Keys to the Kingdom" may give you some authority to act for Jesus, but even the Pope stops short of claiming all the powers of Jesus ad interim.  That's epecially true of the powers given specifically to Jesus.  When the Angel cries out, asking "Who is worthy to open the scroll and loosen the seals of it?" do you and your friends stand up?  No -- that's rerved to the Lion of Judah.  If the Bible says it's a power of Jesus, it's not given to someone else unless there's a specific statement. Jesus has authority to abolish all rule, authority and power. 1 Cor 15:24.   You don't. Jesus immediately 'loosens' speech impediments. (Mar. 7:35).  You can't. He holds all things together. Col. 1:18.  Pastor Doe and Brother Roe can't. When Jesus says "whatever you loosen," He didn't mean you can loosen whatever. 

So what does it mean?  According to Jonathan Leeman, the modern Baptist understanding is this:  
> Whoever has the keys can do what Jesus did with Peter in Matthew 16: listen to a gospel profession and publicly affirm or deny that an individual’s profession is from the “Father who is in heaven” (16:17). Matthew 18 expands this slightly by helping us to see that the holder of the keys should do this in part by considering whether or not a person is repentant. **The authority of the keys, in other words, is about affirming right gospel words (doctrine) and a right gospel life (discipline).**

"Whatever you loose" turns out to be a remarkably narrow grant of authority. The things "loosed" are limited to items specficially discussed in Matthew 16 and 18, specifically listed elsewhere in scripture, or made necessary by implication.  Binding or loosing things beyond that grant risks puts you at the bottom of the Kingdom.  Matt. 5.



Now let's talk about the breakdown of Baptist institutional government around the issue of "ad interim" delegated authority.  

As I have written elsewhere, telling Trustees to "act for the Convention" is meaningless if Trustees do not understand what's supposed to happen.  If you sit in SBC annual meetings, and read the lists of nominees, you might think you are sending 40 or 60 people to govern each entity.  That's the Baptist expectation.  It's also the legal expectation: "when a number of directors are elected to manage the affairs of the corporation, it is contemplated that the corporation shall have the benefit of the judgment, counsel and influence of all of those directors.” 2 William Meade Fletcher et al., Fletcher Cyclopedia of Law of Corporations § 406


But in the entities I have any insight into, that is a sham. The entities find it much easier to operate with a small group of cardinals on an executive committee. 

This is obviously the case at the ERLC, where I am an at large Trustee.  The ERLC's Bylaws say the Trustees are to set CEO pay, but the Trustees did not vote on the "love gift" to departing CEO Russell Moore. Few trustees know the CEO's compensation, as they are required to sign NDAs to be told.  

The ERLC's bylaws also say new committees are to be named by the "Trustees."  But in the last transition, the Chairman of the Trustees named his own search committee.  This round, after my request for a meeting of the full board to discuss a transition, the ERLC's Executive Committee named the search committee -- without any specific consultation of the other Trustees.  That committee includes three members of the Executive Committee, plus the Chairman as an ex officio member.  I am told the Trustees will be given the opportunity to 'ratify' the Chairman's actions, but five Trustees are naming a committee for the 40 Trustees.  Why?  It's certainly not impossible to get all 40 of us on the phone or on zoom.  It's justified by an ERLC bylaw that says the Executive Committee "may act for the Trustees ad interim."  And so insiders give gifts to insiders without consulting us, and the insiders will pick the next candidate for CEO. 

[Lifeway's Chairman Jimmy Scroggins also unilaterally named a search committee of seven (out of 50) to find the successor to Dr. Thom Rainer](https://blog.lifeway.com/newsroom/2018/08/29/lifeway-trustees-begin-search-for-new-president/). Scroggins then, allegedly, signed off on a more-than-one-million-dollar retrirement agreement, without informing the rest of the Board.  After Scroggins rolled off as chairman, Lifeway's apparently shocked Executive Committee sued Rainer to recover the money. But the shocked executive committee apparently failed to poll the whole board before acting.  The shocked full board (including Scroggins!) called an emergency Trustee meeting, but [the full board's meeting was cancelled by its Executive Committee](https://christianindex.org/lifeway-reverses-course-dispute-pursues-rainer/). Apparently, the Executive Committee interpreted its ad interim authority to include *undoing and contravening* actions of the full board. 

Under Paige Patterson, the SWBTS Executive Committee terminated the President of the institution, days after a vote by the full board to retain him.  According to Baptist Presss, the [search committee for his replacement was named, unilaterally, by the Chairman of the Board](https://www.baptistpress.com/resource-library/news/swbts-appoints-9-member-presidential-search-committee/).  And when two Trustees were accused of wrong doing, it was the SWBTS EC that 'suspended' two Convention-elected Trustees.

And, of course, there has been no shortage of public fighting about the *ad interim* authority of the SBC Executive Committee, and the exercise of that authority by the officers of the Executive Committee.  In a kind of super Executive Committee apparently controls the agenda of the organization.  And in reaction to efforts to control the ECEC, other SBC institutions appear to be trying to distance themselves.   The ERLC-EC vociforously complained about an investigation of the ERLC beginning in the EC-EC. When the EC-EC enquired about the SWBTS-EC's suspension of two Convention-elected Trustees, SWBTS coordinated to pass Resolution at the SBC Annual Meeting -- a resolution that few understood, other than it affirmed Bart Barber's memory of statements made by Convention lawyers in 2010.   

To be clear, I am split about whether some of these actions were the right decisions; should Patterson have been fired?  Probably.  Should Lifeway have pursued Rainer's sweetheart deal?  Probably.  

What I am concerned about is the death of the SBC's polity for accountability.  "The Trustees" are not in charge.  A small committee is in charge at each institution, usually influenced by the CEO.

If you send new Trustees, and charge them to "act for the SBC," things will not change.  They will, no doubt, do their best to "act for the SBC," but they must understand what the SBC values.  If the SBC values efficiency, then boards with fifty trustees are a waste.  If the CEO's salary can be set by five friends, not fifty, why should we ask fifty?  If the CEO candidates can be controlled by the chairman and five friends, why open the door to disagreement?  If the Executive Committee can do it, isn't it more efficient to do it with five?

For most the SBC's history, Baptists in the pew would have understood that 'efficiency' wasn't the goal, but the overall health of the cooperative efforts of Southern Baptists.  There are 40-60 people on each board to make sure board-level questions are reviewed by Baptists from each region.  And there are 86 Executive Committee members with the power to *talk* to Trustees at each entity, with the specific purpose of understanding what's going on. (SBC Bylaw 19.)  So for every major decision, 40 Baptists vote, and 120 should know about it. 



I challenge you to figure out who is on the executive committee for the ERLC, or Lifeway, or SWBTS at any given time.
