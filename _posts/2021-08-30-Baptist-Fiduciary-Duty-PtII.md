Your Southern Baptist Convention entities have a Matthew 18 crisis.

No, not a Matthew 18:15 crisis, about how to deal with sin in the church.  A Matthew 18:18 crisis, about handling delegated authority.  

In Matthew 18:18, Jesus leaves the Church with some authority. In between the already and the not yet, He says: 
> Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.

That's some truly awesome **ad interim**[^1] authority; it's the church's 'in between' authority. And it sounds enormous. Elsewhere, Jesus said something similar to Peter, giving him the "Keys to the Kingdom of Heaven."   **Whatever you bind on earth? Whatever you loose on earth?**  That certainly sounds like a lot of authority.

But what did it really mean when Jesus said the church can loosen and bind for Him?  He 'loosed' Lazarus from the dead (John 11:44); can I revive my dead relatives? Jesus has power over flesh; can we pray the common cold out of our churches?  At the Name of Jesus, every knee will bow; should the masses bow at our name and reflected authority, too?   No.

Okay, so maybe those aren't the kind of powers God gives away.  What about powers God does give away in the Old Testament?  Can a couple of us grow long hair and get super strength?  Can three of us split the Red Sea? Stop the sun? Hit a rock and get water? No.

So was Jesus *lying* when he said two or more Christians have His authority? No.

"Whatever" might look like a big wad of general power, but it wasn't. The general words ("keys," "whatever") are interpreted in context and with reference to other scriptures.  In introductory hermaneutics, pastors learn the principle of non-contradiction -- the Bible should be interpreted not to contradict itself.  

Giving the church "Keys to the Kingdom" may give it some authority, but even the Pope doesn't claim all the powers of Jesus **ad interim.**  That's epecially true of the powers given specifically to Jesus.  When the Angel cries out, asking "Who is worthy to open the scroll and loosen the seals of it?" do you and your friends stand up?  No -- that loosing is reserved to the Lion of Judah.  If the Bible says it's a power of Jesus, it's not given to someone else unless there's a more specific statement.  Jesus has authority to abolish ('loose') all rule, authority and power. 1 Cor 15:24.   You don't. Jesus immediately 'loosens' speech impediments. (Mar. 7:35).  You can't. He binds all things together. Col. 1:18.  Pastor Doe and Brother Roe can't. 

When Jesus said "whatever you loosen," He didn't mean you could loosen whatever.

So what does it mean?  According to Jonathan Leeman, the modern Baptist understanding is this:  
> Whoever has the keys can do what Jesus did with Peter in Matthew 16: listen to a gospel profession and publicly affirm or deny that an individual’s profession is from the “Father who is in heaven” (16:17). Matthew 18 expands this slightly by helping us to see that the holder of the keys should do this in part by considering whether or not a person is repentant. **The authority of the keys, in other words, is about affirming right gospel words (doctrine) and a right gospel life (discipline).**

"Whatever you loose" turns out to be a narrow grant of authority, in context. The things "loosed" are limited to items specficially discussed in Matthew 16 and 18, specifically listed elsewhere in scripture, or made necessary by implication.  Binding or loosing things beyond that puts you at the bottom of the Kingdom.  Matt. 5.

# SBC entities and ad interim authority. 

If you sit in SBC annual meetings, and read the lists of nominees, you might think you are sending 40 or 60 people to govern each entity.  That's the Baptist expectation.  It's also the legal expectation: "when a number of directors are elected to manage the affairs of the corporation, it is contemplated that the corporation shall have the benefit of the judgment, counsel and influence of all of those directors.” 2 William Meade Fletcher et al., Fletcher Cyclopedia of Law of Corporations § 406

But in the entities I have any insight into[^2], that's not the case. The entities find it much easier to operate with a small group of cardinals on an executive committee. And so your new Trustees are told to be efficient, by letting the small group run things *ad interim.* 

This is obviously the case at the ERLC, where I am an at-large Trustee.  The ERLC's bylaws specifically say the Trustees are to set CEO pay, but the Trustees did not vote on the May 14, 2021, "love gift" to departing CEO Russell Moore. Few other trustees even know the CEO's compensation, as they are required to sign NDAs to learn it.

The ERLC's bylaws also say all new committees are named by the "Trustees."  But in the last transition, the Chairman of the Board named the search committee, by himself.  This time, the ERLC's Executive Committee announced its search committee -- without any specific consultation of the other Trustees.  That search committee includes three members of the ERLC's executive committee, plus the  Chairman (in  an ex officio role).  I am told the Trustees will be given the opportunity to 'ratify' the Committee in September 2021, and accept their nominee in September 2022. So five Trustees have decided the size and scope of the search, when there are nearly 40 Trustees.  Why? It's certainly not impossible to get all of us on the phone, or ask for email nominations.  

It's justified by an ERLC bylaw that says the Executive Committee "may act for the Trustees *ad interim*."  Management reads those words like Catholic Cardinals read Matthew 18: "wherever there are three or more Executive Committee members, there are the real Trustees, and whatsoever money the Trustees control, the Executive Committee may set it loose."   And so there is a defacto heirarchy. The inside circle feels comfortable giving bon voyage gifts without consulting the other trustees, and selecting the CEO search committee without their input. That's just the way the the ERLC is supposed to work, they believe.     

And to be fair, there's evidence this is how several SBC entities now work.  [Lifeway's Chairman Jimmy Scroggins also  named a search committee of seven (out of 50) to find the successor to Dr. Thom Rainer](https://blog.lifeway.com/newsroom/2018/08/29/lifeway-trustees-begin-search-for-new-president/). Scroggins then, allegedly, signed off on a more-than-one-million-dollar retrirement agreement with Rainer, without informing the rest of the Board.  After Scroggins rolled off as chairman, Lifeway's apparently shocked executive committee members orderd Lifeway to sue Rainer to recover the money. But the shocked executive committee apparently failed to poll the whole board before acting, and the shocked full board called a Trustee meeting.  In a twise, [the full board meeting was cancelled by Lifeway's executive committee](https://christianindex.org/lifeway-reverses-course-dispute-pursues-rainer/)! Apparently, they interpreted their *ad interim* authority to include *undoing and contravening* actions of the full board. 

Under Paige Patterson, the SWBTS Executive Committee terminated the President of the institution, days after a vote by the full board to retain him.  According to Baptist Presss, the [search committee for his replacement was named, unilaterally, by the Chairman of the Board](https://www.baptistpress.com/resource-library/news/swbts-appoints-9-member-presidential-search-committee).  And when two Trustees were accused of wrongdoing, the SWBTS EC suspended two Convention-elected Trustees, without a vote of the full board.

And, of course, there has been no shortage of public fighting about the *ad interim* authority of the SBC Executive Committee, and the exercise of even that authority by the officers of the Executive Committee. And in reaction to efforts to control the ECEC (or to hinder ~barbarian fundamentalists~ pirates), other SBC institutions appear to be trying to protect themselves from the EC.  But some of those efforts strike me as trying to saw off the entity's branch from the SBC trunk. Freedom from the trunk may feel like flying above the barbarians, but only for a few moments.  


# The death of Cooperative trust and accountability

What's the point of all this?    The point is to say "the Trustees" are not running your entities. I challenge you to figure out who is on the executive committee for the ERLC, or Lifeway, or SWBTS at any given time.  Those are the Trustees you are, in fact, trusting.

Do executive committeess always make the wrong decisions? Not always. But they always make decisions that are *worse* for SBC purposes. 

  that will cause the death of Baptist cooperation.   And while that strikes *me* as the end of the Baptist system, and a cancer on cooperative trust, and the opposite of what Baptists expect, few Trustees will upset the apple cart for a grumpy lawyer.  
Today, many new Trustees are chosen because of their inexperience, and to *introduce them to SBC leadership.*  That may be a good goal, but those new Trustees quickly realize a small committee is in charge -- and no one is telling them to expect otherwise.  Most of those new Trustees will turn to the Chairman and CEO, the leaders thriving the most under the current system.  

So even if Baptists 'clean house' and charge new trustees to 'act for the Convention,' things won't change.  They will, no doubt, do their best. But the SBC must say what it wants. Otherwise, 'act for the Convention' boils down to a business-like goal: 'be cheap and efficient.' 

If "act for the SBC" means "be cheap and efficient," then boards with fifty trustees are a waste.  Would you rather have your performance and pay judged in a one-on-one meeting with the chairman you carefully politicked to get on your board, or by sixty Baptists chosen by the messengers?  Why not allow the chairman to pick and define the searach committee by himself?  If the Executive Committee can do it, isn't it *always* more efficient to do it with fewer people?  

Our system is *horribly* inefficient if a few Baptist cardinals could do the same job for less money. And so it's important to understand that a Baptist cardinal *can't do the job.*  The job is not just to *decide* but to *decide in a way that lets messengers grow in confidence and justifies more investment for gospel purposes.* 

So Baptists created a system where there are 40-60 people on each board to manage the CEO, and so that all board-level questions are answered by Baptists from each cooperating convention.  And there are 86 Executive Committee members with the power to *talk* to Trustees at each entity, with the specific purpose of understanding what's going on for the Convention as a whole. (SBC Bylaw 19.)  So for every decision, 40-60 Baptists have a vote, and 86 more will know about it, with pastors and laymen from each geography near the deciion.  There's a cloud of witnessess between each annual meeting, bigger than any single SBC political schism. It's too many people to hide probelms from, so they must be dealt with in a trustworthy manner. 

When SBC entities claim *ad  interim* power, but mute, avoid, or push back against the *ad interim* cloud of witnesses, Baptists should be wary.  I have long understood concerns about the SBCEC interfering with decisions made by Trustees.  But the SBCEC has the role of *talking and asking* for the whole Convention even where its *actions* are limited. We should favor open, not closed, decisionmaking at the SBCEC and all our entities.   

I will continue to explain to the ERLC's trustees why the phrase "act for the Trustees ad interim" in our bylaws is far more limited than Richard Land or Russell Moore believed.  But no matter how limited the language, if Baptists *want* Trustees to turn the reins over to a smaller committee, then it will continue to happen.  

So as a Trustee, I'm asking the SBC Executive Committee to consider asking the Messengers to request that all entities prefer final decisions by the full boards.  Executive committees can assist full boards in making the right decisions, but committees should not make decisions for full boards, except in true emergencies. And in the age of Zoom, there are precious few actual emergencies that can't be handled by full board. No payoff, no search committee, no lawsuit settlement, and no referral from the messengers should be settled by commitees.  No CEO's salary, compensation, or benefits should be set by committees.

Putting all the Trustees in charge is a necessary step before Baptists can ever "trust the trustees."  If you support this idea, please let the entity trustees and SBC Executive Committee members from your state know -- that could be ten or twenty people.  Thanks in advance.
