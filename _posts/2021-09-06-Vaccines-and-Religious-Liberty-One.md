The frazzled nerves of Americans are on full display as summer vacation ends and parents must make COVID plans for their students.   In April, we all hoped that we could get jabbed and relax.  Instead, we face another year of warring science, pseudoscience and politics.

The most frazzled seem to be in the professional classes.  People still want too-simple solutions and one-step plans.  The too-simple answer here has been to "get the vaccine, and this will end."  Which has turned into a one-step blame game: "if this doesn't end, it's because you didn't get the vaccine." 

Understandably, no one wants to be blamed for prolonging human suffering unnecessarily.

Unfortunately, I've noticed some normally patient Evangelical leaders trying to cajole unvaccinated evangelicals recently.  And they're using *spiritual* pressure. In order to show a watching world that Evangelicals aren't to blame, they claim that real evangelicals will get the vaaccine.  And so they must undermine the religious liberty claims of tens of thousands of Evangelicals who are claiming religious exemptions. 

It leads to a logic like this:  
  * Claim 1: Fringe religious groups might have religious beliefs implicated by vaccines, but Evangelicals really can't. 
  * Claim 2: Because Evangelicals can't have religious beliefs impacted by vaccine mandates, Evangelicals who claim religious exemptions are insincere. 
  * Claim 3: If we allow insincere (fraudulent) Evangelicals to seek religious exemptions, it will "hurt us when we really need religious liberty."

But this is not an *argument*; this is Bulverism.[^1]  

Let me say, I am vaccinated. I'm a cancer survivor, and "natural is best" strikes me as an unsteady guide to medicine. People are *alive* because I was scientifically poisoned with very unnatural substances in the '90s.  I'm incredibly glad for the common grace of scientists and officials who have produced the temporary defense against COVID-19 in record time. And, on balance, it seems to me that the vaccines will save enough lives to justify the risks.  "Pretty healthy" people are dying from COVID.  Most of you should take reasonable, ethical precautions to avoid death, and for most people, I think the vaccine is reasonably safe and reasonably ethical.

But while I share the 'mainstream' evangelical conclusion, it's quite wrong to suggest all the other evangelicals are liars and loons.   

And that third claim is particularly dangerous, because it isn't limited to COVID.  Instead of viewing "religious liberty" as a Christian *obligation* to fellow humans, it sees "real religious liberty" as a chip in our negotiations with the State. It is the religious liberty you'd use to retain influence in a coalition government, not the principled religious liberty of early Baptists. 


# Vaccine Ethics are a balancing test, not a switch. 

First things first: can Evangelicals have religously-motivated objections to taking a vaccine?  Yes.  Evangelicals can have different opinions and still be Evangelicals.  And Evangelicals can have different conclusions about the vaccines and still be Evangelicals.    

The media likes to talk about religion and vaccines like there's a switch.  For Christian Scientists, the switch is off.  For Christians, the switch is on. For Roman Catholics, the Pope himself seems to say the switch is on.  So if you're a Christian who claims the swtich is "off," the thinking goes, you must be using false religious claims to mask some other, non-religious motive.

But that's not how Christians actually think or write about vaccines. 

The most common ethical concern about the vaccines is their relationship to stem cells. The stem cell lines at issue came from an aborted fetus, but the abortion occurred in the 1960s. The cells from that fetus have been made to replicate and replicate and replicate, and are commonly used in medical testing. According to the best information I have, some COVID vaccines are produced using stem cells; others only test using stem cells.  

Are there *any* Christian, religiously-motivated concerns about using cell lines originating in an immoral act? The answer has always been "yes," there are at least concerns.    

In 2008, the Catholic Congregation for the Doctrine of of Faith wrote that "the aim of public healthcare cannot justify voluntary abortion in order to obtain cell lines for vaccine production -- and thus their distribution and marketing is also morally unlawful in principle."  But -- and this is the big but -- "grave reasons may be morally proportionate to justify the use of such 'biological material'."   

"Proportionate" invokes the idea of a fraction or balancing test. If there grave reasons to use improperly obtained material, those grave reasons must outweigh the wrong. Presumably, fine lines and crow's feet are not "grave reasons," so stem cells in cosmetics remain off limits.  But, *death* is the sine qua non of "grave reasons." Where there is a risk of death, the ethical question involves proportionality. Most of us know the basics of that balancing. You can speed on the way to the delivery room, or kill someone in self-defense. None of us want to think too hard about being in the position of the Donner Party.    

At the danger of making things seem more precise than they really are, a balancing test works like an equation.  You should take a COVID vaccine if GR[ave reasons] are sufficiently more than the E[vil] involved.   Or something like GR > E.  

In 2017, the Pontifical Academy for Life issued a note about how to balance stem cells and vaccines.   The abortion was a long time ago, the use of the stem cells didn't require any new abortion or other evil act.  So we were left with a formula where the evil reduces proportionately as the time increases, something like: 

GR > E/t   

The Academy approved the use of clinically proven vaccines, even if they contained stem cell lines. But it wasn't quite clear how the clinical approval worked in relation to the ethical balancing test.  Was it that the clinical approval solved ethical procurement decisions? Or were they saying something about the amount of time that had passed?  In terms of our formula's variables, were they saying E=O or that E/t=~0?

It seems to be the latter.  The Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith continues to talk in terms of the proportinality test. In December 2020, [it acknowledged that some COVID-19 vaccines use ethically suspect materials](https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/it/bollettino/pubblico/2020/12/21/0681/01591.html#ing), but that the farther from the initial wrong, there are "differing degrees of responsibility" in cooperation with that evil. Christians should prefer vaccines that do not use ethically suspect material, it said. But where a vaccine prevents *death,* ethics allow a Christian to decide a clinically-approved vaccine outweighs any residual cooperation with the original wrong.   

But, the Congregation says, those ethics assume vaccines are voluntary. 

And, the Congregation expected some Catholics to continue to have objections, or to prefer some vaccines over others, based on whether they used stem cells. "Those who, however, for reasons of conscience, refuse vaccines produced with cell lines from aborted fetuses, must do their utmost to avoid, by other prophylactic means and appropriate behavior, becoming vehicles for the transmission of the infectious agent."


# Ethical balancing tests depend on individual conscience

If  Catholic institutiions say the vaccine is acceptable, why do they allow that others may reach a different conclusion?   

Because the real moral work is not in establishing the formula. The hard part is assigning values to moving targets. At what point can you always feel right about indirectly benefiting from an unethical abortion in the 1960s? At what point does God stop judging?  

That's hard to say, apart from your conscience. 

Obviously, the easiest way to justify the decision is to make sure the Grave Risk always outweighs the Evil.  And the easiest way to do that is to make sure E=0 -- if there's no evil involved, it doesn't take much of a reason.  

That seems to be the consensus position of Catholic and Evangelical ethicists that I respect. Ryan Anderson, Robbie George, and other Catholic thinkers have said as much in Public Discourse; that position has largely been echoed by Andrew Walker and C. Ben Mitchell in a corresponding evangelical essay.  Anderson, et al., deny that stem cell lines are "body parts" or "human tissue;" they're immortal, biological products.  And the distance from the original abortion means there is no "contribution, cooperation, or promotion" of abortion. Thus, E=0. 

To all this, I say: maybe. Yes, there's a difference between the original fetus and the descended tissues. Yes, sixty years is a long time ago.  Yes, the ship has mostly sailed; stem cell products are used so widely, it's nearly impossible to live in the United States without benefitting in some way from ethically questionable stem cells.   

But it also has the feel of throwing your hands up. "They're everywhere" doesn't say when unethical stem cells turn into ethical stem cells. These experts can tell us they think E is now *approaching* zero, based on their experience with moral dilemmas and their own consciences, and the cold hard realities.  But none of their arguments are proof that E *is* zero.  

And how could they say there's *nothing* wrong with stem cell vaaccines, while still encouraging scientists to develop alterntaives to these stem cells?  Why waste time that could be used to develop other cures? There must be some substance to E, no matter how small it seems after 60 years.  

So despite all the theoreticians explaining why the vaaccine is ethical, it is still derived from a balancing test, not a switch.   

And, so, question inescapably involves judgment.  

It involves your own judgment, of course.  Life unavoidably involves hard decisions about complicity. All things being equal, I'd choose a vaccine that does not involve stem cells.  But at the risk of being wrong, I judge the good of either choice to outweigh the connection to a murky 1960s abortion.  

But it ultimately boils down to God's judgment. Inescapably, if I am wrong, God will judge me. He will judge every person's decisions about proportionate responses, whether it is about COVID vaccines or speeding to the delivery room or killing in self defense.

So unless you can rule out evil, the claim of Evaangelical vaccine exemption is a claim that looks like *many, many religious claims*: "please do not make me do this thing that God says I should not do."  And it is in the same, Christian framework; it does not depend on non-Christian assumptionss.  It just depends on assigning a different weight to the wrong, or a different effect to the passage of time. 

And if there is anything open to debate, it is how to measure evil and the effect of time.   The Christian consensus is that there's nothing wrong with a good steak, but vegans and vegetarians have a different view about the evil of factory farming.  Modern social justice movements say there's collective and macroscopic complicity by people who benefit from systems of racism begun hundreds of years ago. The 1960s is more than my lifetime, but it's hardly time immemorial. We know that God is, in a sense, outside time -- but also interested, acutely, in resolving the smallest bits of evil.
