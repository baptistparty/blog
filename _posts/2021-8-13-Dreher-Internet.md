Rod Dreher shares thoughts on an essay by Steve Skojec: 
> It was especially interesting to me to read Skojec, a man I’ve been following for years, consider that those non-trads who believe that there is something valuable in depicting the beatified young Acutis as he was in life might have a point. This is not the Steve Skojec of old. Something is changing within him.

> What’s changing in him is something that is going to come for all of us, if it hasn’t already.

The Internet is *apocalyptic* in the old sense.  It isn't the "end times," but it is *revealing.*  In the same way the fruit in the Garden was promised to be apocalyptic, and the "Revelation to John" was apocalyptic.   If the Internet apocalypse isn't entirely spiritual, it is similar to the apocalypse of the printing press, which led to the Reformation and the Engligtenment.

The Internet, in some ways, pulled back the curtain on both.  There are no sustainable heroes in a world of 24/7 cameras, and when everyone is complicit in history.  And there are not many sustainable taboos when videos of every taboo are widespread -- and the subjects seem to be having fun, contrary to what the books and authorities told you.  Both the Enlightenment and the Reformation developed ways to think about authority; those modes of authority are now under steady criticism, and seem quite tired.   

Gutenberg's press predated Luther's theses by about a century;  I suspect the answers to our present apocalypse may be away, off in the distance.
