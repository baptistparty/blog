Do you remember the stories about George Soros and the Southern Baptist Convention?

Those stories started in fairly respectable places.  [Julie Roys](https://julieroys.com/is-evangelical-immigration-table-a-front-group-for-george-soros/). [The Instititue on Religion & Democracy's Juicy Ecumenism blog.](https://juicyecumenism.com/2013/06/05/the-evangelical-immigration-table-exposed-as-another-soros-front/).  They made a big splash on Breitbart, and then on blogs.  And then the ERLC 

Way back in 2012, the explanation was that the National Immigration Forum had invited Evangelicals to form an "Evangelical Immigration Table."  NIF was funded in part by a who's who of the left, including George Soros's Open Society Foundation. And its board was a who's-who of the very left-left, including labor unions and La Raza.  But the invitations to EIT went to some very conservative evangelical groups, including the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission.  The "table" seemed like a luncheon group. 

But soon, the "EIT" began running political ads in Washington, targeting key immigration bills.  And so, naturally, the question was how evangelical charities were buying political ads. Was offering plate money going to political advocacy? Or was the group being used by NIF's left and left-left donors? 

You'll recall that in 2021, JD Greear back in 2012, Baptists were wary of direct political engagement. The head of the ERLC at the time, Richard Land, assured Baptists that the ERLC and the EIT controlled the messages and the ads, and were not beholden 

Whenever the church gets in bed with politics, the church gets pregnant. And our offspring does not look like our Father in Heaven.
