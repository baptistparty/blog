On the right wing of American politics, there has been a lot of debate over "liberalism."  

In Machen's "Liberalism and Christianity," 'liberalism' was on the other side.  So it might seem natural for Baptists and other evangelicals to join in the fray.

But these aren't critics of 'liberals,' they're critics of 'liberal democracy.' The political tradition of the West, at least since the Reformation and Enlightenment. Could you square Baptist anthropology with the idea that "representative democracy" has failed?  

In the 1990s of my youth, almost no one questioned the *idea* of representative democracy.  The Soviet Union had collapsed.  China seemed pliable. Fascism was fading.  By 1992, Francis Fukuyama wrote that we'd turned a  corner; we'd reached "the end-point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government."

But in the thirty years since, "universal" democracy seems like a failed project. China is repressing its citizens politically (as in Hong Kong) and religiously (as in Xianjing).  In the Middle East, thirty years of American effort failed spectactularly in the fall of Kabul. What new nation would uncritically embrace governance advice from a cadre of American advisors?  

And within the United States, right-leaning voters are routinely disappointed in the failure of their elites to conserve anything. Conservatives have fancied themselves as the "real" liberals, who would eventually persuade voters by sheer dint of reason.  But in the space of a decade, 'classical liberals' have lost the shared public meanings of marriage, man, and woman -- a trio not up for real debate in recorded history.  Today's conservatives have watched their social goods recede quickly or slowly, but never make gains. Which is confounding to them. [Republicans, after all, believe they're selling a Fukuyama-like *universal freedom,*](https://morningconsult.com/2021/07/26/state-of-the-parties-what-do-they-stand-for/).  And now their children are embracing atheism and techno-socialism at record levels. Are conservatives just extraordinarily bad at persuasion or is the game rigged against them?  

So our debate over liberalism is not just about liberals, but a debate about liberty.  What do Baptists think about *liberal democracy?* 

For several hundred years, English, Reformed Protestants and their descendants have mostly agreed that more *freedom* is good. Yet those (W)ASPs somehow remained politically, theologically, and socially *conservative.*  And by *conservative,* I mean something like Roger Scruton, who said they believe "the social world emerges through free association, rooted in friendship and community life," and the most important identities and relationships come from beyond the "state."  It was "free association" that allowed people the best chance at maximizing the benefits of those relationships for themselves, especially compared to centralized control or state force.  

That's not to say people always make good choices; the tabloids are full of people who made bad choices. But libertinism or license were supposed to go away with enough *education.*  A "liberal arts education," vaunted by every two-bit college in the United States, was supposed to provide the skills necessary to live as a free man or woman. And this became a shared, bedrock principle of liberal democracy: if you give people all the facts they need, and the freedom to choose, they'll choose to make things better. A primary competition between the American right and the American left was largely a competition about how to exercise all that freedom.  The right thought social convention was important; the left though social convention was constraining. But both agreed that free choice was the way forward: free association, free enterprise, free speech, and free choice are *shared American* values.  

And Baptists have almost always been part of English, Reformed Protestant tradition. Indeed, for most of their history, they've been on the side against religious and political authoritarianism. Early English Baptists sided with James II on questions of toleration; Early American Baptists sided with Jefferson on the "wall of separation of church and state."  Their fundamental belief that men are created equal by God meant Baptists recognized no Pope, and that antebellum Baptists tended to include African slaves as members of their churches.  Baptists are *democratic* in their congregationalism, where every adult member is given a vote, regardless of race or gender. 




So what went wrong? In short, the Internet caused an apocalypse.  

Not *the* apocalypse, but *an* apocalypse, a "revealing."  The Internet apocalypse gave the Western world unparalelled autonomy and free choice.  


Patrick Deneen's 2018 book, "Why Liberalism Failed" suggests we have reached the end of the fused faith in Protestantism and the Enlightenment.
