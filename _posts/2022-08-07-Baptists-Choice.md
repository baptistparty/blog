On the right wing of American politics, there has been a lot of debate over "liberalism."  Liberalism already had a negative conotation among Evangelicals, who know "liberalism" as their opposites in politics and religion.  So it might seem natural for them to join in the fray. 

But critics of liberalism have a more sweeping thing in mind: the 'liberal democracy' of Western politics.  Liberal democracy, as in the common political thread linking countries opposed to communism and fascim.  Where it once seemed that liberal democracy had defeated its foes, today it is not so clear. Would any new nation embrace advice from a cadre of US advisors?  How did that work out for Afghanistan?  

So the question is not just about "liberalism," but about "liberty."  For several hundred years, English Reformed Protestants and their descendants have more or less agreed that individual *freedom* and *liberty* is beneficial.  And for all this focus on liberty, they have remained *conservative.*  Roger Scruton says a conservative believes "identities and values are formed through our relations with other people, and not through our relation with the state. The social world emerges through free association, rooted in friendship and community life." But, broadly speaking, the sweep of western political thought has been to treat humans as rational, autonomous actors.  And if given the liberty to make choices, they will more often improve themselves and thereby others.  

That's not to say people always make good choices; obviously people can make bad choices. But libertinism or license were supposed to go away with enough *education.*  A "liberal arts education," vaunted by every two-bit commuter college in the United States, was supposed to provide the skills necessary to live as a free man or woman.       

Patrick Deneen's 2018 book, "Why Liberalism Failed" suggests we have reached the end of the fused faith in Protestantism and the Enlightenment.
