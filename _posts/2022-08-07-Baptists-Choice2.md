For the last few years, the American right has been debating "liberalism."  

In J. Gresham Machen's *Liberalism and Christianity,* of course, liberals were on the other side; it might seem natural for Baptists to join the fight. 

But these aren't critics of 'liberals,' they're critics of 'liberal democracy.' What most of us would think of the political tradition of Western Civilization since the enlightenment. 

At the turn of the century, democracy looked like a permanent winner. The Soviet Union had collapsed, and China looked pliable. Fascism was disappearing. In 1992, Fukuyama famously called it 'the end of history,"  "the end-point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government."   

But thirty years later, that isn't so clear. 

Since the 1990s, most efforts to extend a "universal" liberalism have failed. Beijing is stamping out democratic dissent in Hong Kong, and repressing religious minorities in Xianjang.  After spending billions on Middle East peacekeeping, the US ignominiously withdrew last year, with little to show for it. After Kabul, would any new nation voluntarily embrace a cadre of US advisors on how to build a nation?  

Despite liberalism's weaknesses, the "conservative" parties withi  
    Republican leaders have never successfully reduced the size of government or the national debt; instead, they are oddly fascinated with courting transwomen into the Reagan coalition. Meanwhile, the next generation seems less religious and more socialist, apparently bent on trading liberty for a techno-nanny state.   

So what's broken?  If conservatives What's broken in Conservatism, and what would it take to fix it? 

For several hundred years, English Protestants and their descendants have agreed that more individual *freedom* and *liberty* are good.  Yet they believed the most important relationships come from society, not the state.  And if people are given autonomy and freedom, they .  

Of course, some would make bad choice. But libertinism or license were supposed to go away with enough *education.*  A "liberal arts education," vaunted by every two-bit college in the United States, is supposed to provide the skills necessary to live as a free man or woman.       

Yet hiring a college professor who espouses conservative views is akin to winning the MegaMillions drawing, let alone finding one who became *more* conservative. There are precious few stories of liberal students who come back from college as a Republican; it almost always goes the other way. Why?

The grimmest take is that we went off track half a millennium ago, at the Enlightenment or the Reformation. Patrick Deneen's 2018 book, "Why Liberalism Failed" suggests the collapse is baked into the cake. That liberalism idolizes "freedom," so that liberal societies will keep choosing agaiinst authority.
