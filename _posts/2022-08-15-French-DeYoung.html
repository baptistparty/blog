The Romans has a saying, "in vino, veritas," which meant that wine could lower your inhibitions about telling the truth.  Sometimes, anger works the same way. *In ira, veritas.*  The unvarnished truth floods out, without considering the implications.

Consider David French's recent response to Kevin DeYoung.

DeYoung wrote a mild criticism of professional evangelical criticism, with French as an example. Even valid criticism, said KDY, can descend into Bulverism.  In "Bulverism," a term coined by CS Lewis, the critic stops showing why an argument is wrong and shows how the view is held by the wrong kind of person.  At some point, "[t]here is no persuasion, only pique and annoyance" at the target group.  DeYoung suggested the rhythms of church life are a more productive method of self-criticism, instead of "another critique of the church in your inbox on Sunday morning." 

DeYoung didn't really try to prove that French was over the line. He said there's a point that's too far, and that there are better ways to criticize.  French's concerns are reasonable, but his methods won't produce results.  In theory you could agree with DeYoung (that a line exists) and French (that the line has not been crossed yet).   

But French did not agree to disagree about the line.  Instead, he responded with an attack: DeYoung was misinformed and 'torching' a 'straw man' characterization of French's work. 

So what does *French* say is his work?  What would he say that he is trying to prove?  In tweet 4, he says it clearly: 'White Evangelical theologies' have a 'disproportionate commitment' to Republicans and 'the culture of the South.'  As DeYoung said, no one can prove French has a "wrong" fear.  It is always possible to put short term expediency above long-term, foundational principles. 

How does French prove his claim?  How do he test for this 'disproportionate' commitment to party and culture over religious principle? In tweets 2 and 3, he says white Evangelicals have "propositions" that "don't flow naturally" from their theology.  Their positions on 'Trumpism, anit-masking, anti-vaccine and immigration restrictionism' -- and pointedly: *qualified immunity* -- don't flow from the theology.  

So the *test* is a multidisciplinary test: does the politics follow from the theology?    You'd be forgiven in thinking there must be a multidisciplinary answer; it would have to come from a careful study of theology and law. 

But French says few theologians have the right chops to pass judgment on the law.  "Sadly, when I see pastors wad in on matters of law/policy, it is rare to see superior insight. And when I do it's because of a degree of committed study that is highly unusual."

So who can pass judgment?  "Law and Policy" professionals.  "Those of us who know law and policy on the other hand, know where ideas come from and transparently, obviously know that many (not all!) of the political positions that characterize white Evangelicals don't have any meaningful Evangelical theological origin at all."  

Davis uses qualified immunity -- a legal doctrine that limits when government officials be sued for misconduct -- as an example of this expertise gap. French first says Evangelicals support it disproportinately, which I question; most evangelicals who talk about qualified immunity with me would describe it in terms that make the Cato Institute smile.  But let's say Evangelicals are radically unique in their support for Qualified Immunity.  What's revealing is French's assertion that theology has nothing to say about it. "What's the pastoral insight here as to why a judge-made doctrine that gutted part of the Klan acts should receive disproportionatte Evangelical support?"  The answer to the rhetorical quesiton is supposed to be "none."

That's French's unvarnished truth: in the theo-political issue of his time, the meaningful insight comes from the side of law and politics.  When is Evangelical politics subservient to theology? When David French's law and policy training says so.  Any arguments to the contrary come from people without committed study, people without superior insight, people who don't know where ideas come from; people who don't know where their theologies start and stop.

As a result, few people have enough authority to criticize Frenchian politics; you'd need unusual committment to training in politics and law.  And almost *no one* has standing to criticize Frenchian theology -- that takes theological training *and* political training.  The disciplines don't collaborate, because the theological discipline is mute on key issues of politics. 

As others have said, French has doubled down on Bulverism.  "Those people" are wrong because, as a class, they are people with inferior insight who don't know where ideas come from.

But beyond Bulver, David is taking a sharp, deconstructionist turn.  For evangelicals, the great theo-political issue of our time is the authority of the Biblical text, and from where it gathers its meaning. And French is unsure about the relationship between the Bible, theology, and authority.    

Few evangelicals will openly deny the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy; that too clearly would be the "theological liberalism" identified by Machen.  It was the fight for inerrancy that came to define the PCA and Southern Baptist Convention in the late 20th Century.  No one will say the Bible isn't "true," unless they're defining themselves as a non-Evangelical. 

But the new deconstructionist don't say the Bible's words are false. They deny that the inerrant words are all that clear; your understanding of the words will depend on your social status.  And so in the battle over indeterminate words, how do we pick the winning interpreter?  Shall it be Jonathan Edwards, slave owner, or
