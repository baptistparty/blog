Have you ever run into someone tipsy with anger? The Romans used to say "in vino, veritas," but sometimes it's anger, not alcohol, that lowers inhibitions. A little bump or shake, and the irritated person uncorks.

Consider David French's [recent response to Kevin DeYoung](https://twitter.com/DavidAFrench/status/1471572764549173252).

DeYoung wrote a mild criticism of evangelical criticism. Even valid jeremiads, said KDY, can descend into Bulverism. In "Bulverism," a term coined by CS Lewis, the critic stops showing why an argument is wrong; instead, they show an argument is made by the wrong kind of person. At some point, "[t]here is no persuasion, only pique and annoyance" at the targets. DeYoung suggested the rhythms of church life are a more productive place of self-criticism, instead of "another critique of the church in your inbox on Sunday morning."

DeYoung mentioned French, but didn't try to prove that French was wrong. He just said there is a risk of going too far. You could read the article and agree with DeYoung (that a line exists) and French (that the line has not been crossed yet).

But French responded with hostility to this jostling; apparently, in the present intellectual conflict, there can be no peace without victory. French said DeYoung was torching' a 'straw man' characterization of French's work.

So what does *French* say about his work? In tweet 4, he lays it out clearly: 'White Evangelical theologies' have a 'disproportionate commitment' to Republicans and 'the culture of the South.' As DeYoung concedes, people can forsake theological principle under social pressure, and even that it is important to criticize those who do.

So if we agree the concern is *possible,* how does French test for it? How would we decide if there's a disproportionate commitment to something that isn't religious principle? In tweets 2 and 3, he lays out that claim, with equal clarity. He says white Evangelicals have "propositions" that "don't flow naturally" from their theology. Their positions on 'Trumpism, anti-masking, anti-vaccine and immigration restrictionism' don't flow from theological claims, but political or social claims.

So the issue is multidisciplinary; do the politics follow from the theology? You'd be forgiven in thinking there must be a multidisciplinary answer, something like does the theology contradict the politics?

Yet French says few theologians have the right chops to answer. "Sadly, when I see pastors wad in on matters of law/policy, it is rare to see superior insight. And when I do it's because of a degree of committed study that is highly unusual."

So who can pass judgment? Lawyers and sociologists, perhaps. "Those of us who know law and policy on the other hand, know where ideas come from and transparently, obviously know that many (not all!) of the political positions that characterize white Evangelicals don't have any meaningful Evangelical theological origin at all." 

David uses qualified immunity -- a legal doctrine that limits when government officials be personally sued for misconduct -- as an example of this qualification gap. He says that Evangelicals support it disproportinately, which I question; when evangelicals talk to me about qualified immunity, they use terms that would make the Cato Institute smile. Evangelicals are anxious to hold officials accountable for misconduct. But maybe these are just anecdotes; maybe evangelicals *do* support qualified immunity at radical levels. Does that contradict their theology? 

What's revealing is French's next assertion: the theology practitioner has *nothing to contribute.* "What's the pastoral insight here as to why a judge-made doctrine that gutted part of the Klan acts should receive disproportionate Evangelical support?" The answer to the rhetorical quesiton is supposed to be "none." In a theo-political crisis, the meaningful insight comes from careful students of law and social science, not students of theology.

When is Evangelical theology purusing the wrong politics? When "those of us who know law and policy" say so. French sees his opponents as (likely to be) people without committed study, people without superior insight, people who don't know where their ideas even come from.

So French [doubled down on Bulverism](https://twitter.com/joe_rigney/status/1471695820160385026); people who disagree with his take are often the wrong kind of people. 

Just beyond the Bulverism, though, French's argument takes deconstructionist turn. For evangelicals, the great question is the authority of the Biblical text, and from where it gathers its meaning. And French has just signaled that he is unsure about that authority. 

I'm not saying French denies the Bible is *true.* The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy largely defines evangelicalism, and the fight for inerrancy came to define evangelicals in the late 20th Century. Saying the Bible isn't true is saying you're leaving Evangelicalism. 

Rather, French, like others, has run into the next problem: if it's true, who has the authority to tell David French what these words mean? Jonathan Edwards, slave owner? Paige Patterson, interrogator? Beth Moore, lector? Jemar Tisby, anti-racist? Southern Baptist messengers or Presbyterian elders? Aren't we all trading on human political or social authority in one way or another?

"Did God really say..." interpretations, of course, are as old as the Garden. But closer to our time, Mainline Protestants hit a similar loss of confidence about a century ago, not just in the truth of texts, but in their own ability to understand the law. J. Gresham Machen described the problem of "equal uncertainty" in his 1931 classic, "Christianity and Liberalism":
"The objection involves an out-and-out skepticism. If all creeds are equally true, then since they are contradictory to one another, they are all equally false, or at least equally uncertain. We are iindulgiing, therefore in a mere juggling with words. To say that all creeds are equally true, and that they are based upon experience, is merely to fall back upon that agnosticism which fifty year ago was regarded as the deadliest enemy of the church. The enemy has not really been changed into a friend merely because he has been received within the camp." 

In the law, that uncertainty produced so-called "legal realism." Legal realists didn't deny the truth of the law, they rejected 'formalist' accounts of the law. Humans weren't applying principles to facts, as they claim to do, as the words of the law were indeterminate. Rather, the law was about seeing facts and getting outcomes. To the realists, "[b]efore rules, were facts; in the beginning was not a Word, but a Doing. ... Beyond rules, again, lie *effects.*" [^1] And so, lacking confidence in legal texts, the realists turned to accounting for the 'scientific' effects -- the experiences. 

And here lies the nub: to the realist, it is all too easy for the observable effects to become the analytical tool, the *real* universal principles. And lickety split, the "true truth" is not the text, but observation and judgment about the outcomes. The facts don't support the law, they are the law. And because the text can't compel outcomes, we must settle disagreements between various texts and creeds by resorting to theories that decide for us -- the theories that "help us see effects of sin" where our doctrines do not.

Here, then, is the Evangelical deconstructionist's new truth: the "truth" is not settled by theological law  -- it is settled by authority beyond the reach of pastors and theology.

And that's old-fashioned theological liberalism.
