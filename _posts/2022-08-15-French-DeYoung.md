Have you ever run into someone tipsy with anger?  The Romans used to say "in vino, veritas," but sometimes anger lowers inhibitions, too. Sometimes an irritated person lets loose with what they've been bottling up for months or years.

Consider David French's recent response to Kevin DeYoung.

DeYoung wrote a mild criticism of evangelical criticism.  Even valid jeremiads, said KDY, can descend into Bulverism.  In "Bulverism," a term coined by CS Lewis, the critic stops showing why an argument is wrong; instead, they show an argument is made by the wrong kind of person.  At some point, "[t]here is no persuasion, only pique and annoyance" at the targets. DeYoung suggested the rhythms of church life are a more productive place of self-criticism, instead of "another critique of the church in your inbox on Sunday morning."

DeYoung mentioned French, but didn't really try to prove that French was over the line. There's a point that's too far, said DeYoung.  He even went out of his way to say that French's concerns were reasonable. You could have read the article and agreed with DeYoung (that a line exists) and French (that the line has not been crossed yet).

But French responded with irritation.  French said DeYoung was torching' a 'straw man' characterization of French's work.

So what does *French* say is his motivation?  In tweet 4, he says it clearly: 'White Evangelical theologies' have a 'disproportionate commitment' to Republicans and 'the culture of the South.'  As DeYoung said, no one can prove this is a "wrong" fear; people can forsake theological principle under social pressure.

So how does French say we should evaluate his claim?  How does he test for disproportionate commitment to something besides religious principle? In tweets 2 and 3, he lays that out clearly.  He says white Evangelicals have "propositions" that "don't flow naturally" from their theology.  Their positions on 'Trumpism, anit-masking, anti-vaccine and immigration restrictionism' don't flow from theological claims, but political or social claims.  

So the test is multidisciplinary; does the politics follow from the theology?  You'd be forgiven in thinking there must be a multidisciplinary answer; what does theology say about the law, and what does the law say about the theology?

Yet French says few theologians have the right chops to pass judgment here.  "Sadly, when I see pastors wad in on matters of law/policy, it is rare to see superior insight. And when I do it's because of a degree of committed study that is highly unusual."

So who can pass judgment?  "Law and Policy" professionals; lawyers and political scientists and sociologists, perhaps.  "Those of us who know law and policy on the other hand, know where ideas come from and transparently, obviously know that many (not all!) of the political positions that characterize white Evangelicals don't have any meaningful Evangelical theological origin at all."  

David uses qualified immunity -- a legal doctrine that limits when government officials be personally sued for misconduct -- as an example of this expertise gap. French first says Evangelicals support it disproportinately, which I question; most evangelicals who talk about qualified immunity with me would describe it in terms that make the Cato Institute smile.  But let's say Evangelicals would tell pollsters they support Qualified Immunity at radical levels.  What's revealing is French's assertion that theology has nothing to say about it. "What's the pastoral insight here as to why a judge-made doctrine that gutted part of the Klan acts should receive disproportionate Evangelical support?"  The answer to the rhetorical quesiton is supposed to be "none."

That's French's unvarnished truth: in the theo-political issue of his time, the meaningful insight comes from carefuly study of law and politics.  When is Evangelical theology purusing the wrong politics?  When "those of us who know law and policy" say so. Any arguments to the contrary come from people without committed study, people without superior insight, people who don't know where their ideas even come from.

As a result, few people will ever have enough authority to criticize Frenchian politics; you'd need unusual committment to training in politics and law.  And almost *no one* has standing to criticize Frenchian theology; that takes theological training *and* political training.  But the disciplines don't have to collaborate, because the theological discipline is mute on key issues of politics.

So French doubled down on Bulverism. 

Beyond Bulver, David takes deconstructionist turn.  For evangelicals, the great question of our time is the authority of the Biblical text, and from where it gathers its meaning. And French has just signaled that he is unsure, and trying to cobble together a coalition that disagrees about authority.  

I'm not saying David denies that the Bible is *true.*  The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy defines evangelicalism, and the fight for inerrancy came to define the PCA and SBC  in the late 20th Century.  Saying the Bible isn't true is saying you're leaving Evangelicalism. 

Rather, the current generation of Evangelicals have run into the next problem: who has authority to decide what these true words mean?  Jonathan Edwards, slave owner?  Paige Patterson, interrogator? Beth Moore, lector? Jemar Tisby, anti-racist? 

"Did God really say...," of course, is as old as the Garden. But closer to our time, Mainline Protestants his a similar loss of confidence, not just in texts, but in their own ability to understand texts. And in the law, that ferment produced so-called "legal realism." Legal realists didn't deny the 'truth' of the law, they rejected 'formalist' accounts of the law.  Humans weren't applying principles to facts, as they claim to do; they were generating outcomes. To the realists, "Before rules, were facts; in the beginning was not a Word, but a Doing.  ... Beyond rules, again, lie *effects.*" [1]  And so, lacking confidence in the rules, the realists turned to accounting for the effects. 

And here lies the nub: to the realist, it is all too easy for the effects to become the analytical tool, the *real* principle.  And lickety split, "true truth" is not the text, but our observation and judgment about the outcome.  We don't share the truth of the rule, we share an agreement about the effects.  

Here, then, is the truth behind the outburst: French is not using the Bible to deconstruct Evangelcial errors.  The true truth is his political judgment, which is beyond the reach of pastors and theology.
