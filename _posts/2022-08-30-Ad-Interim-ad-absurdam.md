Your Southern Baptist Convention entities have a Matthew 18 crisis.

No, not a Matthew 18:15 crisis, about how to deal with sin in the church.  A Matthew 18:18 crisis, about authority.  

In Matthew 18:18, Jesus leaves the Church with some power. In between the already and the not yet, He says:
> Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.

That's some truly awesome **ad interim**[^1] authority; it's the church's 'in between' authority. And it sounds enormous. Elsewhere, Jesus said something similar to Peter, giving out  "keys to the Kingdom of Heaven."   **Whatever you bind  Whatever you loose? Keys to the kingdom?**  That sounds like a lot of authority.

But what does the power to bind and loose mean? Jesus 'loosed' Lazarus from the dead (John 11:44); can I revive my dead relatives?  No.

Okay, so maybe that isn't the kind of authority God gives away.  What about powers God gave out in the Old Testament?  Can a couple of us grow long hair and get super strength?  Can three of us split the Red Sea? Stop the sun? Hit a rock and get water? No.

So was Jesus *lying*? No.

"Whatever" might look like a big ol' wad of power, but it wasn't. The general words ("keys," "whatever") are interpreted in context and with reference to other scriptures.  In introductory hermaneutics, pastors learn the principle of non-contradiction -- the Bible should be interpreted not to contradict itself.  

Giving the church "Keys to the Kingdom" may give some authority, but even the Pope doesn't claim *all* the authority of Jesus **ad interim.**  When Jesus said "whatever you loosen," He didn't mean you could loosen whatever.

When the Angel cries out, asking "Who is worthy to open the scroll and loosen the seals of it?" do you and your friends stand up?  No -- that loosing is reserved to the Lion of Judah.  If the Bible says Jesus can do something, that doesn't mean the church can do that something, unless the Bible specficially says so.  Jesus has authority to abolish ('loose') all rule, authority and power. 1 Cor 15:24.   You don't. Jesus immediately 'loosens' speech impediments. (Mar. 7:35).  You can't. He binds all things together. Col. 1:18.  Pastor Doe and Brother Roe can't bind all things -- just some things. 

So what does it mean?  According to Jonathan Leeman, the modern Baptist understanding is this:  
> Whoever has the keys can do what Jesus did with Peter in Matthew 16: listen to a gospel profession and publicly affirm or deny that an individual’s profession is from the “Father who is in heaven” (16:17). Matthew 18 expands this slightly by helping us to see that the holder of the keys should do this in part by considering whether or not a person is repentant. **The authority of the keys, in other words, is about affirming right gospel words (doctrine) and a right gospel life (discipline).**

"Whatever you loose" turns out to be a narrow grant of authority, in context. The things "loosed" are limited to items specficially discussed in Matthew 16 and 18, specifically listed elsewhere in scripture, or made necessary by implication.  Binding or loosing things beyond that puts you at the bottom of the Kingdom.  Matt. 5.

# SBC entities and ad interim authority. 

If you sit in SBC annual meetings, and read the lists of nominees, you might think you are sending 40 or 60 people to govern each entity.  That's the Baptist expectation.  It's also the legal expectation: "when a number of directors are elected to manage the affairs of the corporation, it is contemplated that the corporation shall have the benefit of the judgment, counsel and influence of all of those directors.” 2 William Meade Fletcher et al., Fletcher Cyclopedia of Law of Corporations § 406

But in the entities I have any insight into[^2], that's not the case. The entities find it much easier to hand off their work to an executive committee. And new Trustees are told to be efficient, by letting the small group run things *ad interim.* 

I am an at-large Trustee at the ERLC; what are the major decisions you expect Trustees to be watching?  The ERLC's bylaws specifically say the Trustees are to set CEO pay. But the Trustees did not vote on the May 14, 2021, compensation agreements with departing CEO Russell Moore.  Few trustees outside the EC even know it means to give the CEO X months of pay, because most have not signed the NDA required to know the annual pay.

The ERLC's bylaws also gives the power of starting committees to one group: "additional committees may be named by the Trustees."  So who names the search committee? The Chairman of the Board.   After pressure, The Chairman of the ERLC's Executive Committee had his choices approved by his executive committee.  Most trustees were not consulted about a search committee that includes three members executive committee, plus the  Chairman's advisory role.  I am told the Trustees will be given the opportunity to 'ratify' the Committee in September 2021, and accept their nominee at the annual meeting in September 2022. So five Trustees have decided the size and scope of the search, when there are nearly 40 Trustees.  Is that what you'd expect from bylaws that give the power to the "Trustees?"

This is justified by an ERLC bylaw that says the Executive Committee "may act for the Trustees *ad interim*." Management reads those words like Catholic Cardinals read Matthew 18: "wherever there are three or more Executive Committee members, there are enough Trustees to act."  And so there is a de facto heirarchy among Trustees. The inner circle feels comfortable giving out *bon voyage* gifts and selecting the CEO search committee. That's just the effienct, Baptist way, they have been told.

And to be fair, there's evidence this is how several SBC entities now work.  [Lifeway's Chairman Jimmy Scroggins also  named a search committee of seven (out of 50) to find the successor to Dr. Thom Rainer](https://blog.lifeway.com/newsroom/2018/08/29/lifeway-trustees-begin-search-for-new-president/). Scroggins then, allegedly, signed off on a more-than-one-million-dollar retrirement agreement with Rainer, without informing the rest of the Board.  After Scroggins rolled off as chairman, Lifeway's apparently shocked executive committee members orderd Lifeway to sue Rainer to recover the money. But the shocked executive committee apparently failed to poll the whole board before acting, and the shocked full board called a Trustee meeting.  In a twist, [the full board meeting was cancelled by Lifeway's executive committee](https://christianindex.org/lifeway-reverses-course-dispute-pursues-rainer/)! Apparently, they interpreted their *ad interim* authority to include *undoing and contravening* actions of the full board.

And, of course, there has been no shortage of public fighting about the *ad interim* authority of the SBC Executive Committee.  And in reaction to efforts to control the ECEC (or to hinder ~barbarian fundamentalists~ pirates), other SBC institutions appear to be trying to protect themselves from the EC's actual powers -- and to throw the SBC system of accountability into chaos.


# The death of Cooperative trust and accountability

What's the point of all this?    The point is to tell you that "the Trustees" are not running your entities; at at least one entity, they've been told the *ad interim* authority has been given to executive committees. I challenge you to figure out who is on the executive committee for the ERLC, Lifeway, NAMB -- or even IMB, Guidestone, or the Seminaries. But those are the Trustees you are, in fact, trusting.   

What's wrong with executive committee decisions?  Are they always 'wrong'? Not always. But they always make decisions that are *worse* for SBC purposes. 

Our SBC system is *horribly* inefficient if a few, smart Baptists could do the same job for less money. So it's important to understand that the job can't be done by a few Baptists, like a group of Cardinals. The job is not *deciding efficiently* but *deciding in a way that builds confidence in the Baptists cooperating with the Convention.*  

Building trust is not efficient. Baptists created boards with 40-60 people. They should decide all board-level [^3] questions with Baptists from each cooperating convention.  Then Baptists also assigned the 86 SBC Executive Committee members the power to *openly communicate* with Trustees at each entity, with the specific purpose of understanding what's going on for the Convention as a whole. (SBC Bylaw 19.)  So for every Board level decision, 40-60 Baptists have a vote, and 86 more look over their shoulder, with several pastors and laymen from each geography close to every important decisions.  What is the effect of that system?  It seems inefficient and leaky.  But it turns out group involvement and public knowledge builds trust *among givers to the cooperative program.*

When SBC entities claim *ad interim* power, but push back against the *ad interim* witnesses, Baptists should be wary.  Concerns about the SBCEC interfering with decisions made by Trustees have been aaround a long time.  But the SBCEC has the role of *talking and asking* for the whole Convention even though its *actions* are limited. 

I will continue to try to explain to my fellow ERLC trustees why the phrase "act for the Trustees ad interim" in our bylaws is far more limited than Richard Land or Russell Moore's lawyers told them.  But no matter how limited the authority, if Baptists *want* Trustees to turn the reins over to small groups of Baptist cardinals, it will continue to happen.  

So as a Trustee, I'm asking the SBC Executive Committee to consider asking the Messengers to request that all entities prefer final decisions by the full boards.  Executive committees can assist full boards in making the right decisions, but committees should not make decisions for full boards, except in true inability to gather the board electronically. And in the age of Zoom, there are precious few actual emergencies that can't be handled by a full board. No payoff, no search committee, no lawsuit settlement, and no referral from the messengers should be settled by a small committee.  No CEO's salary, compensation, or annual writing sabbatical should be awarded by committees.

Putting all the Trustees in charge is a necessary step before Baptists can ever "trust the trustees."  If you support this idea, please let the entity trustees and SBC Executive Committee members from your state know -- that could be ten or twenty people.  Thanks in advance.

[^1]: Ad interim, meaning "in the betweentime."

[^2]: Let me be clear in stating that I have no special visibility into entities besides the ERLC, apart from published reports. I would be happy to be contradicted by the bylaws from other entities. 

[^3]: To be clear, neither Boards nor Executive Committees should be micromanaging.  They should only address board level questions.  But every Trustee needs all the information necessary to make informed decisions about those board-level decisions, including CEO performance, pay, and strategy questions.
