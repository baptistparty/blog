The frazzled nerves of Americans are on full display as summer vacation ends, and students (and parents) must make COVID plans.   In April, we all hoped that we could get jabbed, and get it all over with.  Instead, we face another year of science and pseudoscience combined with political and class warfare.   

The most frazzled seem to be in the professional classes other than medicine.  In April, it looked like the virus would be vanquished if we all got the vaccine.  That's less and less clear, but the compulsion to turn the fight into one simple rule persists among the leadership class.  "Get the vaccine, and this will end."  And the close corrollary, then, is "If this doesn't end, it's because you didn't get the vaccine."

And so, in the last few weeks, I've noticed some normally patient Evangelical leaders wade into deep Bulverism[^1], trying to cajole the unvaccinated 'evangelicals' through spiritual pressure. Because evangelical vaccine objectors must be wrong, it is necessary to kick the religious liberty legs from underneath them, for the claim to religious liberty must be wrong, too.

Which leads to the following, disturbing construct: 
  * Claim 1: Fringe religious groups might have religious beliefs implicated by vaccines, but Evangelicals really can't. 
  * Claim 2: Because Evangelicals can't have religious beliefs impacted by vaccine mandates, Evangelicals who claim religious exemptions are insincere. 
  * Claim 3: If we allow insincere (fraudulent) Evangelicals to seek religious exemptions, it will "hurt us when we really need religious liberty."

Let me say: I am vaccinated. I'm a cancer survivor, so "natural is best" strikes me as an unsteady guide to medicine, at least. I'm incredibly glad for the common grace of scientists and officials who have produced this temporary defense in record time. It seems to me that the vaccine will save enough lives to justify the risks in taking it. And if you ask me for my opinion, I'll tell you why I think you should get vaccinated. "Pretty healthy" people are dying from COVID.  Most of you should take reasonable, ethical precautions to avoid death, and for most people, the vaccine is reasonably safe and reasonably ethical.   

But while I hold mainstream evangelical conclusion, it's quite wrong to say the decision is static. All three of the claims in this construct are wrong, and the third claims about religious liberty is dangerous.  Instead of viewing "religious liberty" as a command of Jesus himself that applies to all religious people around us, it treats our view of "real religious liberty" as a chip in negotiations with the State.  It is the speech one might use in negotiating for a cabinet seat in the coalition government. But it isn't the principled religious liberty of early Baptists. 


# Vaccine Ethics are a balancing test, not a switch. 

Can Evangelicals have religously-motivated objections to taking a vaccine?  Yes, because Evangelicals can have different opinions and still be Evangelicals.   

The media likes to talk about religion and vaccines like there's a switch.  For Christian Scientists, the switch is off.  For Christians, the switch is 'on.' For Roman Catholics, the Pope himself seems to say the switch is on.  So if you're a Christian who claims the swtich is "off," the thinking goes, you must be using false religious claims to mask some other, non-religious motive.

But that's not how Christians actually think or write about vaccines. 

The most common ethical concern about the vaccines is their relationship to stem cells. The stem cell lines at issue came from an aborted fetus, but the abortion occurred in the 1960s. The cells from that fetus have been made to replicate and replicate and replicate, and are commonly used in medical testing. According to the best information I have, some COVID vaccines use stem-cell lines in production.  Some COVID vaccines use stem-cell lines only in testing. 

Are there *any* Christian, religiously-motivated concerns about using cell lines originating in an immoral act? The answer has always been "yes," there are at least concerns.    

In 2008, the Catholic Congregation for the Doctrine of of Faith wrote that "the aim of public healthcare cannot justify voluntary abortion in order to obtain cell lines for vaccine production -- and thus their distribution and marketing is also morally unlawful in principle."  But -- and this is the big but -- "grave reasons may be morally proportionate to justify the use of such 'biological material'."   

"Proportionate" invokes the idea of a fraction or balancing test. If there grave reasons to use improperly obtained material, those grave reasons must outweigh the wrong. Presumably, fine lines and crow's feet are not "grave reasons," so stem cells in cosmetics remain off limits.  But, *death* is the sine qua non of "grave reasons." Where there is a risk of death, the ethical question involves proportionality. Most of us know the basics of that balancing. You can speed on the way to the delivery room, or kill someone in self-defense; none of us want to think too hard about being in the position of the Donner Party.    

At the danger of making things seem more precise than they really are, a balancing test works like an equation.  You should take a COVID vaccine if GR[ave reasons] are sufficiently more than the E[vil] involved.   Or something like GR > E.  

In 2017, the Pontifical Academy for Life issued a note about how to balance stem cells and vaccines.   The abortion was a long time ago, the use of the stem cells didn't require any new abortion or other evil act.  So we were left with a formula where the evil reduces proportionately as the time increases, something like: 

GR > E/t   

The Academy approved the use of clinically proven vaccines, even if they contained stem cell lines. But it wasn't quite clear how the clinical approval worked in relation to the ethical balancing test.    Was it that the clinical approval solved ethical procurement decisions? Or were they saying something about the amount of time that had passed?  In terms of our formula's variable, were they saying E=O or that E/t=~0?

It seems to be the latter.  The Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith continues to talk in terms of the proportinality test. In December 2020, [it acknowledged that some COVID-19 vaccines use ethically suspect materials](https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/it/bollettino/pubblico/2020/12/21/0681/01591.html#ing), but that the farther from the initial wrong, there are "differing degrees of responsibility" in cooperation with that evil. Christians should prefer vaccines that do not use ethically suspect material, it said. But where a vaccine prevents *death,* ethics allow a Christian to decide a clinically-approved vaccine outweighs any residual cooperation with the original wrong.   

But, the Congregation says, those ethics assume vaccines are voluntary. 

And, the Congregation expected some Catholics to continue to have objections, or to prefer some vaccines over others, based on whether they used stem cells. "Those who, however, for reasons of conscience, refuse vaccines produced with cell lines from aborted fetuses, must do their utmost to avoid, by other prophylactic means and appropriate behavior, becoming vehicles for the transmission of the infectious agent."


# Ethical balancing tes
ts depend on individual conscience

But the real moral work is not establishing the formula. It's assigning values to variables. At what point can you feel okay about indirectly benefitting from an unethical abortion in the 1960s? 

Obviously, the easiest way to justify the decision is to make sure the Grave Risk always outweighs the Evil.  And the easiest way to do that is to make sure E=0 -- if there's no evil involved, it doesn't take much of a reason.  

That is the consensus position of Catholic and Evangelical ethicists that I respect. This is the position of Ryan Anderson, Robbie George, and other Catholic thinkers in Public Discourse, and the position of Andrew Walker and C. Ben Mitchell in corresponding evangelical essay.  Anderson, et al., deny that stem cell lines are "body parts" or "human tissue;" they're immortal, biological products.  And the distance from the original abortion means there is no "contribution, cooperation, or promotion" of abortion. E=0. 

To all this, I say: maybe.  Yes, there's a difference between the original fetus and the descended tissues. Yes, sixty years is a long time ago.  Yes, the ship has mostly sailed; stem cell products are used so widely, as a practical matter, they're practically impossible to avoid.  

But it also has the feel of throwing your hands up. "They're everywhere" doesn't say when unethical stem cells turn into ethical stem cells. These experts can tell us they think E is now *approaching* zero, based on their experience with moral dilemmas and their own consciences. But none of their arguments are proof that E *is* zero.  And I'm not sure how they could prove that, while also calling for ethical vaccines for all.  There must be some substance to E, no matter how small it seems after 60 years.  

So we are struck with a balancing test, not a switch.   

And, to be fair, that is the choice I understand I am making.  Life unavoidably involves these decisions.  If I am wrong, God will judge.  He will judge every person's decisions about proportionate responses -- whether it's COVID vaccines or speeding to the delivery room or killing in self defense.   

But evangelicals can disagree about how time and complicity relate.  The Christian consensus is that there's nothing wrong with a good steak, but Christian vegans and vegetarians can have a different view of how they might be complicit in the mistreatment of animals. Modern social justice theories suggest collective and macroscopic complicity by people who benefit from systems of racism begun hundreds of years ago. And the Bible itself says a day is as a thousand years to God.  Why presume 60 years is enough distance between the abortion and the beneficiary of the vaccine?     

If sixty years justified the cells, what about Surely, if we needed a new line of stem cells tomorrow, it would be wrong to procure an abortion for them, even if we could be sure it would take another 70 years before another abotion was needed. 


There are several ways to break this 'formula.'  

First, it's hard to quantify "evil."  The equation only works if I can reason my way into comparing the evil of an abortion or the use of the aborted baby's cells with the value of my own life.  At best, it is a version of the Trolley Problem, asking people to compare two human lives.  

Most educated people have encountered the problem, and know the utilitarians say the driver of the Trolley should throw a switch to kill the fewest number of people possible.  But Christian ethics resist easy, utilitarian conclusions.

Second, you could assume the evil is infinite.  If you believe the evil is especially heinous, or the victim is especially innocent, you could just say all human life is of infinte worth, and refuse any complicity at all. 

Third, you could deny that time ameliorates anything. If t=0, then the evil should be treated as if the abortion were being contemplated right now. 








# Some Evangelicals will have sincere, theological opposition to taking a vaccine.

  Shortly after innoculation was developed, there were theological arguments for and against it.  Edmund Massey, M.A., preached a sermon in 1722:  "[Against the Dangerous and sinful Practice of Inoculation](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/evans/N02782.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext)"; it was republished in Boston in 1730, amid an inoculation controversy.   Edmund's arguments were that illness is sent to punish sin or test the faith, so that resort to inoculation reflected a lack of faith: 

  > Let the Atheist then, and the Scoffer, the Heathen and Unbeliever, disclaim a Depen|dance upon Providence, dispute the Wisdom of God's Government, and deny Obedience to his Laws: Let them Inoculate, and be Inoculated, whose Hope is only in, and for this Life! But let us, who are better in|structed, look higher for Security, and seek principally there for Succour, where we ac|knowledge Omnipotence: Let us not sinfully endeavour to alter the Course of Nature by any presumptuous Interposition: Let us bless God for the Afflictions which he sends upon us, and the Chastisements wherewith he intends to try or amend us; beseeching him to grant us Patience under them, and in his
 
The Massachusetts religious establishment took the other view.  Increase Mather wrote in favor of it, and William Dodd preached [a sermon still republished in medical journals](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/1175412).  But, of course, inoculation might be reasonable, but it still held risks. And Jonathan Edwards famously died after his smallpox inoculation, showing that even reasonable actions are no guarantee against death.   

In 1777, John Newton wrote a letter, acknowledging that some were taking the vaccine as a "salutary expedient which God in his providence has discovered..."  But then he described the thinking of the vaccine hesitant: 
> My times are in the Lord’s hands; ...  If I am to have the small-pox, I believe he is the best judge of the season and manner in which I shall be visited, so as may be most for his glory and my own good; and therefore I choose to wait his appointment, and not to rush upon even the possibility of danger without a call. If the very hairs of my head are numbered, I have no reason to fear that, supposing I receive the smallpox in a natural way, I shall have a single pimple more than he sees expedient; and why should I wish to have one less? Nay, admitting, which however is not always the case, that inoculation might exempt me from some pain and inconvenience, and lessen the apparent danger, might it not likewise, upon that very account, prevent my receiving some of those sweet consolations which I humbly hope my gracious Lord would afford me, if it were his pleasure to call me to a sharp trial? ... Besides, at the best, inoculation would only secure me from one of the innumerable natural evils the flesh is heir to; I should still be as liable as I am at present to a putrid fever, a bilious colic, an inflammation in the bowels, or in the brain, and a thousand formidable diseases which are hovering round me, and only wait his permission to cut me off in a few days or hours: and therefore I am determined, by his grace, to resign myself to his disposal. Let me fall into the hands of the Lord,[] for his mercies are great ...

Much the same arguments were present in Britain in the last half of the 1800s, when rigorous enforcement of vaccine requirements led to the formation of the Anti-Vaccination Leagues. Parents could be fined and imprisoned for failing to vaccinate -- and in Leicester alone, more than 6,000 prosecutions were brought. [Archives of Disease in Childhood, 1984, 59, 1195-1196](https://adc.bmj.com/content/archdischild/59/12/1195.full.pdf).  The religious rhetoric was heated; "Religious arguments were some of the most profoundly terrifying of the anti-vaccinators. With the fate of the soul of both parent and child at stake, the choice to oppose vaccination seemed clear."  The opposition to mandatory vaccination was led by clergymen, including Rev. William Hume-Rothery (COE) and Archdeacon Colley.  [Wrote Hume-Rothery](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Vaccination_and_the_Vaccination_Laws_a_p/RWEvRf6hzmMC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Hume-Rothery+Vaccination&printsec=frontcover): "There is no principel or eternal law which is God's will as revealed to man, underlying, justifying or illustrating this unnatural practice, which must, therefore be unprincipled or atheistic and consequently not merely opposesed to all that is good, but fraught with evils which it would be difficult to estimate."

Colley couched the vaccines as ungodly modification of the body: "what insolence to suggest that the Almighty cannot perfect His own work in the gift to us of a tender infant, without
medical intervention and the sacrilegious alteration of the composition of the blood."  Others suggested the vaccines allowed “demons and ghouls
into the glorious tabernacle of the body, the inside of which they should never see." (Walter, Madison P., "The Rhetoric of Nineteenth Century British Anti-Vaccinators: An Interdisciplinary Movement of Medicine,
Religion, Class, and Popular Culture" (2015). Student Scholarship. Paper 8.)

The battles remained heated, and even violent.  In 1885, an estmiated 100,000 people marched against vaccination in Leicester, closing factories and warehouses; that same year, French Canadians violently rioted in Montreal, wrecked the health department, and threatened to shoot authorities supporting vaccines.  Anti-vaccination groups tended to endorse compulsory quarantine or hospitalization, which did seem to allow for control of smallpox outbreaks where the system was adopted. 

These vaccine-mandate battles lasted almost five decades in Britain, from compulsory vaccination in 1853, until [parliament allowed for conscientious objection in 1898](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-50713991).

Nearly all of these arguments against vaccination seem wrong to me today.  Wrong on the facts, wrong on the science, wrong on theology.  Almost from the start, they go left where I'd go right. But I have the benefit of time and hindsight.  Yet it's impossible to say all these objections were *fraudulent.*  To suggest that an objector is "insincere" in his religious objection, you are accusing them of *knowing* their objection isn't grounded in religion, or that they know their religious arguments are wrong.   The "Church of Weed where Weed is Illegal" is insincere; the "High Prestess of the Sex Church" was insincere.

But that's clearly not the case for religious opponents of vaccination.  They did believe their objections were, in part, religious.  And I don't think they knew their religious arguments were wrong.  The fact that similar arguments keep reapearing in Evangelical churches over the centuries tells us these are Evangelical arguments.  It's tempting to Bulverize the reasons they went wrong: they didn't love their neighbor, they didn't trust the science, they were engaged in a neo-fundamentalist hermeneutics, or they really just don't like being told what to do.  But it's impossible to say the religious objections were insincere.
