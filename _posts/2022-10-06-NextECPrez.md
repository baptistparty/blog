I [published a video on my short campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs4I1XKLVL0) for President of the Southern Baptist Convention's Executive Committee.

Six, Actionable Ideas If I Were SBCEC CEO:

1. TRANSPARENT SALARY DISCLOSURE
2. TRANSPARENT 990-LEVEL FINANCIALS
3. TRANSPARENT BOARDS DECIDE, NOT COMMITTEES
4. ACCOUNTABILITY -- ALL TRUSTEES ARE SBC TRUSTEES
5. ACCOUNTABILITY -- REASSESS GROUP EXEMPTION LETTER
6. ACCOUNTABLE, TRANSPARENT  & INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS
