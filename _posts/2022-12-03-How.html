In 2018, new evangelicalism's political theology hit its peak. 

MLK50 was supposed to be a celebration of evangelical progress, fifty-five years after King's Letter from a Birmingham Jail. It marked the last time a fusionist, evangelical political coalition would appear together. 

The divides were most apparent in terms of *age.* The senior statesmen of American, reformed evangelicalism spoke glowingly of The Civil Rights movement; the sermons delivered by John Piper and John Perkins and Rusus Smith all talked about the Evangelical response to the Civil Rights Movement.  They spoke largely in the biblical and spiritual rhetoric of that movement. 

But many of the younger speakers were ready to move beyond the CRM's goals and methods. They rejected racial egalitarianism, colorblindness, and individualism. Citing post-civil rights movement radicals, they talked of a world where color mattered in nearly every context. It was the language of critical studies and sociology.      

Since MLK50, Evangelicalism itself has fractured (or is fracturing), in ways similar to the mid-twentieth century split between the Evangelicals and the “mainline.”  That story has usually been oversimplified into a battle between "fundamentalists" and "liberals," with the liberals denying that the Bible was "inerrant."  But there were three decades between Machen's       

Baptists and Presbyterians split away from each other, theologically and politically.  There is a difference between the PCUSA and the PCA, or the ABC and the SBC. And there is a brewing split between traditional and “deconstructionist” evangelicalism.



A significant issue in the fracture is what it means to be a “theological liberal.”  The aging boomer evangelicals are not wrong to sense echoes of the 1960s ‘Marxism’ and ‘liberalism’ among the younger generation.  The younger generation claims they are “conservative theologically, but not always politically.” They accuse political conservatives of being fundamentalists or misogynists, or dupes for abusive leaders.



The vision of new evangelicalism hoped to build on the mid century vision of Carl F.H. Henry and Billy Graham.  The evangelicalism of Baby Boomers has been politically, culturally, and economically prosperous, even as it had never quite been accepted in the halls of power.  Instead of being “counter culture,” it was subculture.  Wheaton was seen as the Harvard of evangelicalism; Kirk Cameron its Tom Cruise.



But the new Evangelicalism had always had designs on a place in respectable culture, not just subculture.  This isn’t quite obvious on first glance.  Many of the senior statesmen of new evangelicalism were separatists even in Christian culture. They were associated with Calvinism and the serious study of texts; the decried the unserious hucksterism of televangelists, and pandering politicians. 



This less emotional, more academic approach was surprisingly compatible (in hindsight) with Ethos of the American managerial class.  YRR developed at the tail end of what Aaron Renn has called “neutral world.”  At the highest reaches, Christianity was a positive social good among the upper-middle classes, from the founding through at least the 1960s and 1970s in America. In the next two or three decades, Christian faith was seen as something neutral.  



I attended Harvard Law School just after the turn of the century, at the end of this neutral world. Evangelicalism was an “affinity” group — along with the Catholics and LDS and the Federalists and the American constitution society. 



But it was possible to be an evangelical in good standing at HLS while also being a serious scholar. Professor Bill Stuntz was widely respected as a criminal law scholar —- and was a devout, conservative Presbyterian at a PCA. To be sure, Conservatives were the minority, and their ideas were rarely received charitably or uncritically.



But the Conservatives and Most of the HLS faculty shared a high view of man’s rationality and autonomy, what we might call “Enlightenment” values.  Some may describe them as “classical liberalism.”  If we disagreed about what choices to make, there was a tacit understanding that the way forward was to understand the relevant facts and maximize the freedom of autonomous individuals to make better choices. This Liberty had beaten communist command and control societies, the thinking went, because it moved faster and took account of the knowledge of the masses that bureaucrats could never master.  Prosperity and progress were maximized by free choice among informed and educated citizens.



This was neutral world.  And it was possible for evangelicals to make headway in this world, if they made good arguments or showed good data about the benefits of their choices; this allowed others to make good choices, even if they did not share the evangelical’s theological motivations.  So perhaps taxes were too high and choking off business; or perhaps taxes were too low and depriving Americans of the public goods that enabled choice — roads, schools, libraries, healthcare. There was a pitched battle over sexual choice — was it better to retain traditional monogamy and marriage or would we all be happier loosening the mores around sex?



But this neutrality was unsteady at HLS. My first year at Harvard was the last year of Robert Clark’s deanship. Clark had become dean in 1989, the end of a hotly contested war between proponents of Critical Legal Studies and “Traditionalists.” The “crits” versus the “trads.” The “Crits” were the most radical extension of legal realism .. the realists of the 30s denied that law had any fixed meaning in texts. The Crits, by the 1970s, had combined legal,realism with various radical critiques of Western society as a whole, especially Marx’s goals of egalitarianism and the ‘democracy’ so peculiar to dictators.



Clark had studied for the priesthood before going to law school, and then wrote a masterful work on corporate law in 1986, the height of the Regan revival in markets. 



The selection of Clark represented the Trad victory over the Crits.  In 1990, Derrick Bell — the “father of Critical Race Theory” — took a leave from Harvard, calling it a “protest” against Harvard’s lack of black female professors.  In 1992, HLS refused to extend Bell any further leaves, ending his career at Harvard. Others associated with Critical Legal Studies stayed on the faculty, (such as Duncan Kennedy and Mark Tushnet), but the need for Marxist understandings of the law seemed to lessen as America crested toward the End of History.



The Trads were helped by the reaction of the American right to “liberal judges.” The Trads were still “liberals”; often realists or proceduralists who reached their apex in the Supreme Court of Chief Justice Earl Warren.  The Warren Court had been freed from the text of the law, much the way German higher criticism had freed many theologians from the text of the Bible.  > The law, therefore, did not exist in a metaphysical realm of fundamental rules or principles, but was inseparable from human action and the power of judges to determine the law. In order to understand the decisions and actions of legal actors, legal realists turned to the ideas of the social sciences in order to understand the human behavior and relationships that culminated in a given legal outcome.[4]



But the Warren Court’s discovery of a host of “rights” in the Constitution produced a reaction. Most notably, Roe v. Wade, which claimed to find a nearly unfettered, federal right to abort unborn children in the right to privacy — itself a right recognized only by a Warren court the “penumbra” of other rights. In Roe, even the right to life was reduced to a policy and social science question.



Roe invigorated the right and the left. On the right, business and traditionalists recognized they would be at the mercy of judges if policy and outcomes were left to the Supreme Court.  And Crits, of course, saw proof that liberalism *was* just a front for power and control — in fact, it now claimed ultimate control over life and death of the innocent, not just the criminally guilty.  Crits just believed the wrong, mainline Protestant society was in the drivers seat.



On the right, scholars like Robert Bork and Antonin Scalia began developing arguments against untethered ‘realism.’ Most of us will recognize this as the start of the “textualism” or “originalism” movement. Bork, at Yale, and Scalia, at Chicago, said the law does not derive its legitimacy from agreeing with social science, but from text. And not simply text, but from the original publicly-shared meaning of texts. And while texts might allow some construction or interpretation, the legitimacy of law depended on words really meaning something.  There are interpretations within the text and outside the text.  But judges were not priests that could settle social science and policy questions about the life and death of innocent Americans. This was not a power given to them under the organic laws of the United States.





It is no coincidence that the same debates about the authority of texts were playing out in American Theology as well as law. During the Warren a court era, Evangelical scholars at Fuller Seminary and Gordon Conwell and The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary were also trying to apply social science, literary criticism, and political theory to their faith. Most of their academic peers dismissed the Bible as an example of Ancient Near Eastern wisdom literature, to be interpreted as such; to the extent the Bible was up supposed to have authority, you measured the legitimacy of 5,000 year old texts the same way the  Warren Court measured the legitimacy of 200-year old Constitutions: did it produce good outcomes?  If social science or modern morality called for a different outcome, a justification could be found in the penumbras and emanations of the text.  



When Roe was announced, most of the evangelical intelligentsia supported the outcome. Both the legal and scriptural texts were made subservient to the outcome.
