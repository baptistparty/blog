                                <p>What good is a Baptist trustee? </p>
<p>This summer, Southern Baptists will elect a President.  That President will appoint a committee.  Then, the committee will appoint another committee.  Then, <em>that</em> committee will present slates of trustees for each SBC entity.  And at the next annual meeting, messengers will, by and large, approve those trustees. </p>
<p>What are those trustees supposed to do? </p>
<p>Well, everyone agrees they should <em>meet.</em>   But what do they do when they meet?   Their lawyers will say something like &ldquo;they should fulfill their fiduciary duty.&rdquo; If the trustees do something controversial, you'll hear people call for new trustees that &ldquo;represent the Convention.&rdquo; Another group might say to "trust the trustees."</p>
<p>But imagine you cleaned house and every trustee promised to &ldquo;do their duty&rdquo; and &ldquo;represent the Convention.&rdquo; Would things change?  </p>
<p>Well, if &ldquo;cleaning house&rdquo; ever worked, it wasn't because people promised to live by these phrases.  </p>
<p>Until recently, Baptist churches shared a fairly radical congregational polity.  Even big Baptist churches -- Spurgeon's Tabernacle, RG Lee's Bellevue,  Criswell's First Baptist Dallas -- gave ultimate authority to members.  And those members held regular meetings and made important decisions.  If you had to sat in monthly church business meetings for years, and approved enough budgets, there was a good chance you shared some similar understandings about Baptist theology and conventions. After all, someone had to explain why all this money was going to the Cooperative Program.  SBC ministries had to make sense to people in the pews.  And those people fiercly opposed religious hierarchy, even as they were compelled to reach the world for Christ. </p>
<p>In a time with strong, shared convictions about the Convention's purpose and limits, then an occasional &ldquo;house cleaning&rdquo; might do some good.  It would have swept away people with concerns that don't reach local churches.  Those concerns could be good or bad, but the sweep would tend to bring &ldquo;new blood,&rdquo; people fresh from the pragmatic concerns of the pews.  </p>
<p>Of course, Baptists are all-too-familiar with entities &ldquo;captured&rdquo; by some other concerns.  Southern Baptists in the 1960s and 1970s faced a Convention bureaucracy that opposed its churches on key theological matters.  But entities can also be captured when they allow secondary goals to become primary goals.  "Growth&rdquo; is good in pursuit of the right purpose.  But &ldquo;growth at any cost&rdquo; can cause sickness instead of health. </p>
<p>Having trained and worked with Baptist trustees for several years, I now see limits to the &ldquo;house cleaning&rdquo; approach.  Fewer and fewer Baptist churches practice strong congregational polity.   Nearly everywhere, pastors and laymen call &ldquo;business meetings&rdquo; and &ldquo;Roberts Rules&rdquo; archaic, unenjoyable, or a waste of time. So, laymen and pastors picked out of the crowd no longer have a common understanding of local church polity, or how cooperative program giving relates to Baptist theology.  </p>
<p>Too often, we assume a shared foundation that isn't there.  We often portray the Cooperative Program as a clever invention or fundraising method.  And of course, the Cooperative Program is a fantastic method, but so is the...</p>

                                <p><a href="https://alsoacarpenter.com/2021/01/18/carl-truemans-crt-1-basic-claims-of-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="external-link no-image">Brad Mason launches</a> a six-part fisking of <a href="https://www.firstthings.com/article/2021/02/evangelicals-and-race-theory#print" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="external-link no-image">Trueman on CRT</a>.   A quick rundown of part one shows it probably won't go anywhere useful.</p>
<p>Brad's Word Count: 2,669</p>
<p>Brad's claim: Trueman makes three false claims: (a) that CRT has &ldquo;basic claims,&rdquo; (b) among them are &ldquo;racism is systemic&rdquo; and (c) &ldquo;being non-racist is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Brad's Argument 1: CRT is undefinable, therefore Trueman is wrong about claims a, b, and c.  </p>
<ul><li>Response: 
<ul><li>It's impossible to argue an undefinable concept.  We certainly can't prove Trueman is wrong, if there's no definition.  But Brad recognizes this is just preening, and admits in the next section that there really is <em>some</em> consensus about <em>some</em> claims.  </li>
<li>Scholarly language refutation:   Just like "critical legal studies," it is widely accepted both within and outside critical movements that "scholars share sufficient themes, arguments, and approaches "to permit intelligent discussion of the movement as a whole." Johnson, Do You Sincerely Want to Be Radical?, 36 STAN. L. REV. 247, 249 (1984). (Yes, Johnson is writing before CRT proper, but this is fair for all the "critical" theories). </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Brad's Argument 2: Trueman "shows little awareness" of either Critical Race Theory itself or the broader tradition, because scholars of CRT don't use the words Trueman uses in b or c. </p>
<ul><li>Brad's Evidence for the Argument: Brad shows 11 bullet points and a paragraph, and none of them contain the exact words used by Trueman.    </li>
<li>Response: 
<ul><li>Most of this "argument" is spent claiming Brad's target lacks sufficient knowledge, reading, credentials, or training.  This is Brad's most frequent 'argument,' but it is not really an argument.</li>
<li>Brad's eleven bullet points and a paragraph from Crenshaw do not show that Carl has "little awareness" or unfairly characterized or summarized CRT.  Failing to use the same words or phrasing does not tell us whether Trueman understands or misundertsands CRT. The question is whether the words Trueman does use fairly describe the theory.</li>
<li>In showing how "aware" scholars would describe CRT, Brad proves he was wrong about Argument 1.  CRT has some intelligible claims that educated people fairly describe as claims of Critical Race Theory. <strong>Trueman is right about claim a.</strong> </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Brad's Argument 3: <a href="/blog/brad-mason-on-carl-trueman/a" title="Brad says: As for 'racism is systemic,' a way of understanding this claim is certainly included within CRT">CRT does make claims about systemic racism</a>, but Trueman is <a href="/blog/brad-mason-on-carl-trueman/a" title="Brad says: 'But the general idea of systemic racism is an inheritance of the traditional civil rights discourse, not a creation of CRT'">wrong that such claims are exclusive to CRT</a>.</p>
<ul><li>Response: 
<ul><li>Brad admits that CRT makes claims about systemic racism.  "A way of understanding [systemic racism] is certainly included within CRT." <strong>Trueman is right about claim b</strong></li>
<li>Trueman does not say systemic racism is exclusive to CRT, and Trueman never says his argument depends on describing things "exclusive" to CRT.  Argument 3 was a straw man.  </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Brad's Argument 4: CRT does not make a claim about "being non-racist is impossible," so Trueman is wrong about claim c. </p>
<ul><li>Brad's guess: "My guess is that Trueman gets this idea from a marginal awareness of Ibram X Kendi&rsquo;s work ... these definitions are peculiar to Kendi and not particularly reflective of CRT scholarship."</li>
<li>Response: 
<ul><li>Notice that Brad again engages in <em>ad hominem</em> attacks, assuming that...</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol>

                <![CDATA[
                                <p>It's pretty common to read American tech elites claiming to be "disillusioned" with the idea of unrestricted "Free Speech."  The "Popper Paradox" has been turned into an imperative; and the proof is that Twitter and Parler can't seem to reign in the QAnon conspiracy-religion.  So they've concluded speech works best when there's a moderation policy. </p>
<p>There's a variable, though, they don't realize they're holding constant: individual choice.  Twitter and Facebook seem to be tools for extreme self-isolation and cloistering.  If you choose, the only voices in your bubble are those that reinforce your own views.  You can find an audience of people who think Fox News has been taken over by leftists, or that the Religious Right was formed for the express purpose of opposing desegregation.  </p>
<p>In the old-fashioned town square, it was nearly impossible to wall yourself off from opposing opinion.  In techno-America, we can  wall ourselves off from opposing opinions more hermetically than the President himself.</p>
<p>So it doesn't seem to me that Free Speech has failed; rather, we've artificially crated conditions under which speech is only allowed to isolate.  We've become atomized to the point that we don't hear dissenting voices -- unless they're passed along with a "can you believe this" framing.  But whatever Twitter and Parler are, it is not just an experiment with "free speech."  It's a dopamine experiment where subjects can affirm themselves into insanity.  </p>
<p>It would be interesting to see Twitter take Free Speech seriously, not just dopamine hits. Maybe we should hear from others in our community, or from other communities.  Heck, we should just hear the other side from <em>the same people.</em> Everyone is familiar with the phenomenon of the incindiary tweet that is RT'd millions of times, and then retracted in a later tweet.    It should be trivial to show the retraction tweet to the <em>same people</em> who saw this misinformation.  But Twitter will not do that -- too many customers want timelines of pristine doom and anger.  The retraction shames them for believing outlandish claims.  The machine for unmitigated doom and anger is, apparently profitable.  </p>
<p>But before letting BigTech kill the entire idea of Free Speech, or giving AWS veto authority over public discussion, I'd try changing the  algorithims that help Americans self-isolate and self-radicalize. </p>

                <![CDATA[
                                <p>WSJ posts an "adaptation" of Ben Friedman's new book,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Religion-Rise-Capitalism-Benjamin-Friedman/dp/059331798X/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=religion%2Brise%2Bof%2Bcapitalism&amp;qid=1610908135&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="external-link no-image"> <em>Religion and the Rise of Capitalism</em> (Amazon)</a>.   He argues that, contrary to Max Weber, American economics is tied to mainline optimism about human action: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>By Adam Smithâ€™s time, however, Protestant thought had turned away from the idea of predestination. The English and Scottish clergy began to preach instead that men and women are endowed with reason and that human character is inherently good. John Tillotson, the Archbishop of Canterbury in the late 17th century, argued that far from being predestined to heaven or hell, people can â€œcooperateâ€ with God in effecting their salvation. As the philosopher John Locke put it in a famous metaphor, people have â€œthe candle of the Lordâ€ by which to see and then act.</p>
<p>...
In broader terms as well, our economic thinking reflects its optimistic religious origins. The respect we attach to economic self-improvement as an expression of political liberty; our commitment to economic development on the national and even world scale; our belief that economic progress leads to moral progress too; above all, our trust in competitive markets as a way to harness individual economic energies for the broader goodâ€”all of these bedrock principles show that the influence of religious thinking on American capitalism isnâ€™t just historical but ongoing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can begin to see how American "woke" capitalism continues this theme.  By and large, American capitalism wants social and economic progress to be companions, not competitors, and our latest Great Awokening is no exception.  </p>

</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The epoch times was founded in 2000 by John Tang, an Atlanta-based follower of the Chinese spiritual movement Falun Gong, whose members you might have seen doing meditative exercises in parks, and whose living messiah is Li Hongzhi, a cherubic-faced man generally shown wearing dark suits. The movement, which claims to have millions of adherents, encourages believers to abandon lust, greed, alcohol, and other worldly â€œattachments.â€ Some of the more unusual characteristics of its outlook include a distrust of medical doctors and a belief in malevolent, Earth-roaming aliens who created impious technology (such as video games). In 1999, the Chinese government concluded that Falun Gong was growing too popular. Beijing labeled the movement a cult and suppressed it. But Falun Gong flourished abroad among the Chinese diaspora, and its teachings took on a fervent anti-Communist bent.</p>

<p>One source of the crap: too much separation of church and state. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you deny to government the chance to explicitly acknowledge the kingship of Christ in the very particular and specific way that government ought to, then it becomes very difficult to define the exact relationship between God and government. So government will constantly be veering toward an over-definition of its submission to Jesus or an under-definition of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another: personal property, and individual self-designation. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, they simply created their own identities, independent of geography and independent of any concern with neighbor. And it is this act of self-designation that Jennings sees as being the heart of â€œwhiteness.â€...
The economic views exist because an extremely thick doctrine of private property is central to that autonomyâ€”self-designating is expensive, basically. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been critical of the long conservative tradition of sniffing out Marxism everywhere in intra-evangelical justice debates.  But now the theory is that personal autonomy should be reduced by altering the doctrine of private property, for the benefit of society? </p>
<p>Isn't that ... socialism? </p>

<p>I grew up in the suburbs of Kansas City.  Kansas, of course was the home of Carry Nation, and much of this region is ... abstemious.  Kansas City managed to stay "wide open" during Prohibition, but the Carry Nations mostly won the social argument after the fall of the local boss, Tom Pendergast.  Until, say, the advent of Boulevard beer, alcohol remained at arms length; Ann Coulter clerked for a local judge in the 1980s, and wrote about how surprising the Kansas City social scene was, because it didn't center around alcohol. </p>
<p>For most of my life, the borders of "dry country" have been shrinking. Even among my co-religionists, the Baptists, while teetotaling remains the public position, over my lifetime it's gone from an urgent moral crisis to something more like our version of veganism.  You won't lead a Baptist institution right now with a scotch in hand, but it's increasingly common to have churches accept it at weddings and social events, without risking excommunication. </p>
<p>Which is to say, 'temperance' was once a (high) class marker.  For the past 40 years, alcohol consumption has been a high-class marker.  I expect the pendulum is swinging back toward abstention being the marker of learning and high-class.  There have been a fairly steady series of academic studies saying that alcohol has no health benefits, and lots of social costs.  And here come the books for popular consumption. </p>
<p>I suspect the Baptists gave up, just as the science was about to shift in their favor.   It will be interesting to watch. </p>
